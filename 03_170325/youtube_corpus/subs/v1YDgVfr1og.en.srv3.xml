  <p time="23560" is_ac="true">that my life looks slightly different in</p>
  <p time="25039" is_ac="true">comparison to what it did in December I</p>

  <p time="100759" is_ac="true">January and February is actually my</p>
  <p time="102320" is_ac="true">favorite book of all time this is a</p>
  <p time="103439" is_ac="true">reread for me it is near to the Wild</p>
  <p time="105000" is_ac="true">Heart by clisa Le Specta like when I say</p>
  <p time="106520" is_ac="true">this is my favorite book of all time I</p>
  <p time="107680" is_ac="true">mean like my number one book out of</p>
  <p time="109360" is_ac="true">every book that I've ever read ever it</p>
  <p time="110920" is_ac="true">goes to this as always I'm completely</p>
  <p time="112840" is_ac="true">expected I have fallen in love with this</p>
  <p time="114719" is_ac="true">all over again I am rereading it for the</p>
  <p time="116399" is_ac="true">first time and it's given me so much joy</p>
  <p time="118200" is_ac="true">I just love this book so much I love the</p>
  <p time="119560" is_ac="true">story so much I love the writing so much</p>
  <p time="121439" is_ac="true">l Le Specta is my number one favorite</p>
  <p time="123200" is_ac="true">author of all time she just writes like</p>
  <p time="125280" is_ac="true">no one else in my opinion and everything</p>
  <p time="127039" is_ac="true">that she captures is so full of beauty</p>
  <p time="129200" is_ac="true">and eloquence and it's so raw and I just</p>
  <p time="131400" is_ac="true">think endlessly the way that she writes</p>
  <p time="132760" is_ac="true">just encapsulates the feeling of life</p>
  <p time="135120" is_ac="true">and grieving and love and just all of it</p>
  <p time="138040" is_ac="true">so perfectly I could ramble on about</p>
  <p time="139879" is_ac="true">this forever I'm currently on page 71</p>
  <p time="143440" is_ac="true">and it is less 200 pages so it is</p>
  <p time="144959" is_ac="true">another one that I'm definitely</p>
  <p time="145879" is_ac="true">anticipating to finish in the upcoming</p>
  <p time="147480" is_ac="true">days I just love this book so much and</p>
  <p time="149360" is_ac="true">then lastly book that I'm currently</p>
  <p time="150560" is_ac="true">reading on my Kindle is the song bird</p>
  <p time="152480" is_ac="true">and the Heart of Stone by Carissa</p>
  <p time="153840" is_ac="true">Broadbent I'm currently Bud reading this</p>
  <p time="155280" is_ac="true">with one of my best friends I love</p>
  <p time="156680" is_ac="true">Carissa bbent so much I always said that</p>
  <p time="158319" is_ac="true">she was my favorite fantasy author</p>
  <p time="160040" is_ac="true">definitely still is standing true but</p>
  <p time="161720" is_ac="true">this book I'm not going to lie is</p>
  <p time="162959" is_ac="true">definitely feeling slightly different to</p>
  <p time="164879" is_ac="true">the other books in the series this is</p>
  <p time="166760" is_ac="true">technically the third book in the crowns</p>
  <p time="168319" is_ac="true">of naaia series but the crowns of naaia</p>
  <p time="170400" is_ac="true">series is of course free duologies so</p>
  <p time="172560" is_ac="true">this is the first book in the second</p>
  <p time="174000" is_ac="true">duology in this duy we are following</p>
  <p time="175800" is_ac="true">Meese who was a character in The Serpent</p>
  <p time="177720" is_ac="true">and the wings of night duy and I found</p>
  <p time="179560" is_ac="true">her character really really interesting</p>
  <p time="181040" is_ac="true">I loved her character in the original</p>
  <p time="182920" is_ac="true">duology and I don't know if it's because</p>
  <p time="184360" is_ac="true">I read those like over a year ago and</p>
  <p time="186040" is_ac="true">I'm coming back to chrisa bbent after a</p>
  <p time="187840" is_ac="true">really long time and after reading a lot</p>
  <p time="189400" is_ac="true">more fantasy since then because we know</p>
  <p time="190920" is_ac="true">I've been in a massive fantasy kit for</p>
  <p time="192480" is_ac="true">some reason this is not hitting as much</p>
  <p time="194720" is_ac="true">as I hoped it would and it's making me</p>
  <p time="196239" is_ac="true">so sad because one thing about me I love</p>
  <p time="197799" is_ac="true">this series so much I love Carissa</p>
  <p time="199280" is_ac="true">Broadband I love the crowns of naaia who</p>
  <p time="201040" is_ac="true">am I if I don't love this book I am 50%</p>
  <p time="202840" is_ac="true">of the way through I'm halfway through</p>
  <p time="204200" is_ac="true">and I'm not going to lie I have heard</p>
  <p time="205400" is_ac="true">that the second half gets better and it</p>
  <p time="207159" is_ac="true">leaves on quite a good ending for the</p>
  <p time="209200" is_ac="true">second book in the doy so I'm intrigued</p>
  <p time="210920" is_ac="true">for that I'm just really struggling to</p>
  <p time="212439" is_ac="true">see the chemistry between our two main</p>
  <p time="214599" is_ac="true">characters and our two love interests</p>
  <p time="216280" is_ac="true">and that makes me quite sad but I'm</p>
  <p time="217480" is_ac="true">hoping that it gets better for me and I</p>
  <p time="219120" is_ac="true">enjoy it a lot more yeah those are the</p>
  <p time="220560" is_ac="true">three books I'm currently in the middle</p>
  <p time="221760" is_ac="true">of I am anticipating to read a lot this</p>
  <p time="223640" is_ac="true">week I have been reading a lot lately</p>
  <p time="225200" is_ac="true">I'm in such a reading mood and I'm in a</p>
  <p time="227239" is_ac="true">massive fantasy mood but I'm</p>
  <p time="228280" is_ac="true">simultaneously craving so many different</p>
  <p time="230159" is_ac="true">genres I have no idea what I'm going to</p>
  <p time="231720" is_ac="true">end up reading in this video I</p>
  <p time="232760" is_ac="true">definitely have ideas of what I want to</p>
  <p time="234159" is_ac="true">go on to once I finish these but yeah</p>
  <p time="236760" is_ac="true">that is everything that I'm currently</p>
  <p time="237799" is_ac="true">reading obviously I'm starting this</p>
  <p time="239040" is_ac="true">video on a Monday so let's see how much</p>
  <p time="242350" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="258880" is_ac="true">read hi guys it's now the next day it is</p>
  <p time="261680" is_ac="true">Tuesday and I did a little bit more</p>
  <p time="263479" is_ac="true">reading yesterday of the song bird and</p>
  <p time="264960" is_ac="true">the Hearthstone I really did not read</p>
  <p time="267000" is_ac="true">all that much I did want to read more</p>
  <p time="268720" is_ac="true">than I actually did but I ended up doing</p>
  <p time="270280" is_ac="true">so much filming and so much editing</p>
  <p time="271919" is_ac="true">which obviously I cannot complain about</p>
  <p time="273240" is_ac="true">so I read 68 pages of the song BD and</p>
  <p time="275960" is_ac="true">the Heart of Stone that was all the</p>
  <p time="277199" is_ac="true">reading that I did yesterday I think</p>
  <p time="278520" is_ac="true">that's probably the least amount of</p>
  <p time="279720" is_ac="true">reading that I've done all of February I</p>
  <p time="282039" is_ac="true">have been in such a massive reading mood</p>
  <p time="283720" is_ac="true">lately that I'm literally B reading</p>
  <p time="285680" is_ac="true">books in the morning and especially at</p>
  <p time="287479" is_ac="true">night the last night I was editing until</p>
  <p time="289160" is_ac="true">fairly late so I could not read as much</p>
  <p time="290880" is_ac="true">as I had hoped but I had read a little</p>
  <p time="292880" is_ac="true">bit more this morning also now on page</p>
  <p time="294800" is_ac="true">341 and the book is 500 pages so I am</p>
  <p time="297600" is_ac="true">anticipating to finish it today it says</p>
  <p time="299000" is_ac="true">I've got 2 hours and 5 minutes left</p>
  <p time="300800" is_ac="true">definitely have a lot of work to do</p>
  <p time="302080" is_ac="true">today in terms of editing and emails and</p>
  <p time="304000" is_ac="true">stuff but I do want to make sure that</p>
  <p time="305080" is_ac="true">I'm carving out time to read because I</p>
  <p time="307199" is_ac="true">need to get this book finished I am</p>
  <p time="308680" is_ac="true">enjoying it I do think that my enjoyment</p>
  <p time="310280" is_ac="true">is picked up slightly a little bit more</p>
  <p time="312080" is_ac="true">I feel like the book has picked up</p>
  <p time="313320" is_ac="true">slightly a little bit more I feel like</p>
  <p time="314639" is_ac="true">I'm believing the main characters and</p>
  <p time="316440" is_ac="true">their love interest and their tension</p>
  <p time="317759" is_ac="true">and their Dynamic a little bit more than</p>
  <p time="319000" is_ac="true">I was so that is definitely why I'm</p>
  <p time="320520" is_ac="true">enjoying it a lot more now I am very</p>
  <p time="322080" is_ac="true">intrigued to see where it ends small</p>
  <p time="323840" is_ac="true">when I was reading it in bed I did leave</p>
  <p time="325360" is_ac="true">the chapter on a little bit of like a</p>
  <p time="326880" is_ac="true">cliffhanger so I really do want to get</p>
  <p time="328560" is_ac="true">back to it like I said I am hoping to</p>
  <p time="330160" is_ac="true">finish it today I am definitely planning</p>
  <p time="332080" is_ac="true">on getting a lot more red than I did</p>
  <p time="333680" is_ac="true">yesterday hopefully a lot more than 68</p>
  <p time="335560" is_ac="true">pages but we shall see I'm now going to</p>
  <p time="337240" is_ac="true">spend some time editing I also want to</p>
  <p time="338880" is_ac="true">do my reading journal for a different</p>
  <p time="340440" is_ac="true">video so I want to listen to an audio</p>
  <p time="342240" is_ac="true">book whilst I do that I'm not actually</p>
  <p time="343759" is_ac="true">in the middle of an audio book at the</p>
  <p time="345080" is_ac="true">minute so I am going to have to find a</p>
  <p time="346520" is_ac="true">new one to start I have some ideas of</p>
  <p time="348440" is_ac="true">what I would like to start but we will</p>
  <p time="349960" is_ac="true">see what I find yeah those are all my</p>
  <p time="351639" is_ac="true">plans currently hopefully I read a</p>
  <p time="353240" is_ac="true">little bit more than I did yesterday</p>
  <p time="358620" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="380319" is_ac="true">hi guys I'm now back on my floor what is</p>
  <p time="381840" is_ac="true">it about sitting on your floor that is</p>
  <p time="383120" is_ac="true">always so comfortable I love filming on</p>
  <p time="384840" is_ac="true">the floor but I have some updates</p>
  <p time="386520" is_ac="true">because as I was doing my reading</p>
  <p time="387919" is_ac="true">Journal I started and finished open</p>
  <p time="390199" is_ac="true">throat by Henry hul I listened to the</p>
  <p time="391880" is_ac="true">audio book the audio book was literally</p>
  <p time="393520" is_ac="true">I want to say an hour and 40 minutes and</p>
  <p time="395599" is_ac="true">I tend to listen to my audio books</p>
  <p time="397080" is_ac="true">between like 1.75 and two times speed so</p>
  <p time="400000" is_ac="true">this was an incredibly quick listen</p>
  <p time="401520" is_ac="true">which was perfect as I was doing my</p>
  <p time="402880" is_ac="true">reading journal and I thoroughly enjoyed</p>
  <p time="404599" is_ac="true">this this is an audio book or just a</p>
  <p time="406000" is_ac="true">Noella in general I've had my eye on for</p>
  <p time="407840" is_ac="true">a while I feel like I've seen so many</p>
  <p time="409560" is_ac="true">people absolutely love it whose</p>
  <p time="410800" is_ac="true">recommendations I really trust I know</p>
  <p time="412319" is_ac="true">Jan I think rated it five stars and I</p>
  <p time="414400" is_ac="true">trust our recommendations so I was</p>
  <p time="415960" is_ac="true">always really intrigued by it and then I</p>
  <p time="417560" is_ac="true">saw it on book b and I just thought sure</p>
  <p time="419240" is_ac="true">it with that one and I absolutely adored</p>
  <p time="422080" is_ac="true">it it's such a strange unique</p>
  <p time="424319" is_ac="true">interesting little book we Are</p>
  <p time="425520" is_ac="true">essentially just following a mountain</p>
  <p time="427240" is_ac="true">lion in La I do believe as far as I'm</p>
  <p time="429919" is_ac="true">aware I could be completely wrong please</p>
  <p time="431520" is_ac="true">correct me if I am wrong that this</p>
  <p time="432919" is_ac="true">mountain lion actually existed in LA but</p>
  <p time="435479" is_ac="true">we are following the perspective and we</p>
  <p time="437120" is_ac="true">are following The Narrative of the</p>
  <p time="438639" is_ac="true">mountain lion and one of my favorite</p>
  <p time="440319" is_ac="true">things in literature and literary</p>
  <p time="442080" is_ac="true">fiction especially is when we are</p>
  <p time="443639" is_ac="true">following unique narratives I don't know</p>
  <p time="445639" is_ac="true">why I think the love for it sparked when</p>
  <p time="447080" is_ac="true">I first read the island of missing trees</p>
  <p time="449039" is_ac="true">by El shafak and there were chapters</p>
  <p time="450960" is_ac="true">from the tree itself and I loved it so</p>
  <p time="453199" is_ac="true">much I found it so engaging and so</p>
  <p time="455120" is_ac="true">interesting so I'm always looking for</p>
  <p time="456720" is_ac="true">more books like that that have</p>
  <p time="457919" is_ac="true">incredibly unique narratives and this</p>
  <p time="459680" is_ac="true">was just perfect for that it was such an</p>
  <p time="461319" is_ac="true">incredible read it was so moving we</p>
  <p time="463400" is_ac="true">seeing Humanity through this mountain</p>
  <p time="464960" is_ac="true">lion's eyes like the disgusting and the</p>
  <p time="466840" is_ac="true">disturbing but also the beauty of Being</p>
  <p time="469159" is_ac="true">Human and through that gaze it was just</p>
  <p time="471440" is_ac="true">so interesting I think the fact that it</p>
  <p time="473360" is_ac="true">was so short made it really Pack-a-Punch</p>
  <p time="475280" is_ac="true">I do wish it was slightly longer just</p>
  <p time="476639" is_ac="true">because I was really enjoying the</p>
  <p time="477759" is_ac="true">writing style I definitely want to see</p>
  <p time="479560" is_ac="true">if this Au has anything out published</p>
  <p time="481039" is_ac="true">but oh my God it packs such a punch I</p>
  <p time="482479" is_ac="true">really really liked it so happy that I</p>
  <p time="483960" is_ac="true">just spontaneously decided to listen to</p>

  <p time="535360" is_ac="true">I had an entire day of editing and</p>
  <p time="537279" is_ac="true">filming I was very very productive on</p>
  <p time="539079" is_ac="true">that R I only got anything red once I</p>
  <p time="540880" is_ac="true">got into bed for the night and I</p>
  <p time="542120" is_ac="true">actually did get a little bit of red on</p>
  <p time="543480" is_ac="true">Tuesday I know that I mentioned that I</p>
  <p time="544959" is_ac="true">had red and the entirety and finished</p>
  <p time="546920" is_ac="true">open fro which I also really really</p>
  <p time="548440" is_ac="true">enjoyed but I also read 85 pages of the</p>

  <p time="558959" is_ac="true">final thoughts people weren't lying when</p>
  <p time="560680" is_ac="true">they said that it definitely is better</p>
  <p time="562079" is_ac="true">in the second half did definitely take</p>

  <p time="567440" is_ac="true">but oh my God once I got it it hits so</p>
  <p time="569680" is_ac="true">much I think one of the reasons I love</p>
  <p time="571079" is_ac="true">Carissa bbent so much is I love the way</p>
  <p time="572800" is_ac="true">that she writes fantasy and World</p>
  <p time="574320" is_ac="true">building and the political Intrigue of</p>
  <p time="576000" is_ac="true">it all I think in that front and the</p>
  <p time="577519" is_ac="true">plot is always amazing equally with the</p>
  <p time="579720" is_ac="true">characters I think the way that she</p>
  <p time="580760" is_ac="true">writes characters as individuals but</p>
  <p time="582440" is_ac="true">especially their chemistry she does it</p>
  <p time="584040" is_ac="true">superbly and the smart also so great it</p>
  <p time="586600" is_ac="true">did take me a while to get there for</p>
  <p time="588079" is_ac="true">this one but I really really enjoyed it</p>
  <p time="589640" is_ac="true">in the end I rated it 3.75 Stars the</p>
  <p time="592200" is_ac="true">ending left me gagged I literally sat</p>
  <p time="593760" is_ac="true">there in bed last night and I was like</p>
  <p time="596360" is_ac="true">okay I literally was falling asleep</p>
  <p time="598160" is_ac="true">reading the book and I was like okay</p>
  <p time="599440" is_ac="true">read two more chapters and then one</p>
  <p time="600640" is_ac="true">thing happened and then it was that</p>
  <p time="601680" is_ac="true">classic thing of it was spiraling I</p>
  <p time="603079" is_ac="true">could not go to sleep until it was done</p>
  <p time="604600" is_ac="true">am I happy that I finally finished it</p>
  <p time="605959" is_ac="true">yet because it felt like I was reading</p>
  <p time="607120" is_ac="true">it for a really really long time but now</p>
  <p time="608800" is_ac="true">I'm so eager to read the next book and</p>
  <p time="610560" is_ac="true">it's not until August I don't think more</p>
  <p time="612240" is_ac="true">so this year than ever before I'm really</p>
  <p time="613800" is_ac="true">feeling the impatience of not being able</p>
  <p time="616079" is_ac="true">to finish a series that I'm literally in</p>
  <p time="617800" is_ac="true">love with obviously this one was 3.75 it</p>
  <p time="620200" is_ac="true">wasn't my favorite from her but I still</p>
  <p time="621720" is_ac="true">really really enjoyed it the ending</p>
  <p time="622920" is_ac="true">absolutely made up for it for me I think</p>
  <p time="624480" is_ac="true">the biggest thing that I really</p>
  <p time="625640" is_ac="true">struggled with with this one was I was</p>
  <p time="627160" is_ac="true">really struggling to visualize the sent</p>
  <p time="629480" is_ac="true">into the underworld that the characters</p>
  <p time="630880" is_ac="true">go on throughout the entirety of the</p>
  <p time="632399" is_ac="true">book I was really really struggling</p>
  <p time="633959" is_ac="true">visualizing all of the descriptions I</p>
  <p time="635800" is_ac="true">don't know why I think that that</p>
  <p time="637000" is_ac="true">definitely also took me out the story</p>
  <p time="638360" is_ac="true">but I mean the characters in general I</p>
  <p time="639959" is_ac="true">love meech as a protagonist it did take</p>
  <p time="641920" is_ac="true">me a while to kind of get to grips with</p>
  <p time="643639" is_ac="true">reading from her perspective again I</p>
  <p time="645399" is_ac="true">love Mesa as a main character I loved</p>
  <p time="646800" is_ac="true">her as a side character in the original</p>
  <p time="648519" is_ac="true">duy and it definitely took me a minute</p>
  <p time="650240" is_ac="true">to kind of remember everything that had</p>
  <p time="651600" is_ac="true">happened in that duy but once I</p>
  <p time="653040" is_ac="true">remembered and just reading from her</p>
  <p time="654639" is_ac="true">perspective she's a female main</p>
  <p time="656000" is_ac="true">character that is so strong willed and</p>
  <p time="657680" is_ac="true">is so witty and those are my favorites</p>
  <p time="659839" is_ac="true">in fantasy books and I just love her so</p>
  <p time="661440" is_ac="true">much and I love their Dynamic now I love</p>
  <p time="663079" is_ac="true">the love interest chess I'm scared to</p>
  <p time="664600" is_ac="true">see what happens in the next one because</p>
  <p time="666600" is_ac="true">the ending oh my God I feel like I need</p>
  <p time="668160" is_ac="true">to talk to somebody about it but</p>
  <p time="669320" is_ac="true">actually no one that I know has actually</p>
  <p time="670760" is_ac="true">finished this one I don't think so if</p>
  <p time="672120" is_ac="true">anyone wants to pop me a message on</p>
  <p time="673760" is_ac="true">Instagram so we can talk about this book</p>
  <p time="675279" is_ac="true">I need to let out all of my thoughts but</p>
  <p time="677000" is_ac="true">I really do love chis brand I finally</p>

  <p time="700920" is_ac="true">as sunny as it will be at this time of</p>
  <p time="702399" is_ac="true">the year in the UK but I kind of want to</p>
  <p time="704160" is_ac="true">make the most of it so I really want to</p>
  <p time="705440" is_ac="true">go out I don't know if I want to go to a</p>
  <p time="706720" is_ac="true">cafe today just because I might tomorrow</p>

  <p time="710240" is_ac="true">likely going to go to one together so I</p>
  <p time="711760" is_ac="true">don't know if I also want to go to one</p>
  <p time="712920" is_ac="true">today I do really really want to go out</p>
  <p time="714600" is_ac="true">and in my March TBR I actually got the</p>
  <p time="716639" is_ac="true">prompt to buy and read a book in March</p>
  <p time="718519" is_ac="true">and I'm going to book by buy and band</p>
  <p time="719680" is_ac="true">currently there are so many books that I</p>
  <p time="721160" is_ac="true">really really want to buy once I get off</p>
  <p time="722680" is_ac="true">of my book buy and band I put myself on</p>
  <p time="724279" is_ac="true">a book buy and ban at the beginning of</p>
  <p time="725560" is_ac="true">the year until my birthday which is</p>
  <p time="727320" is_ac="true">April 14th so like the middle of April I</p>
  <p time="729600" is_ac="true">just needed to force myself onto one so</p>
  <p time="731079" is_ac="true">that I actually read my physical TBR and</p>
  <p time="732600" is_ac="true">I'm doing a good job of it right now so</p>
  <p time="734160" is_ac="true">I'm really excited that I got that</p>
  <p time="735240" is_ac="true">prompt because it does mean that I can</p>
  <p time="736399" is_ac="true">go book shopping or just buy one little</p>
  <p time="738800" is_ac="true">book right now I'm kind of leaning</p>
  <p time="740240" is_ac="true">towards buying the second book in the</p>
  <p time="742000" is_ac="true">Rose Hill series I'm pretty sure it's</p>
  <p time="743760" is_ac="true">what it's called I read Wild Love in a</p>
  <p time="745360" is_ac="true">recent reading Vlog and I really really</p>
  <p time="746839" is_ac="true">loved it actually it was my first LSC</p>
  <p time="748240" is_ac="true">silver I know that you're technically</p>
  <p time="749560" is_ac="true">meant to read the chestnut spring series</p>
  <p time="751040" is_ac="true">first but I'm just going to do this</p>
  <p time="752160" is_ac="true">series first and then probably go on to</p>
  <p time="753440" is_ac="true">that they are so fun and they are</p>
  <p time="754560" is_ac="true">definitely such good pilot cleansers I</p>
  <p time="755959" is_ac="true">had a really good time with wild love so</p>
  <p time="757480" is_ac="true">I would love to get onto the second book</p>
  <p time="758839" is_ac="true">especially because I think the third</p>
  <p time="760199" is_ac="true">book is coming out soon obviously that</p>
  <p time="761760" is_ac="true">does mean that I would read the second</p>
  <p time="763279" is_ac="true">book in March so I might go to the works</p>
  <p time="765399" is_ac="true">and see if they have that there I feel</p>
  <p time="766760" is_ac="true">like they might have it fairly cheaper</p>
  <p time="768040" is_ac="true">than water stone so I might go out and</p>
  <p time="769680" is_ac="true">do that today and if I do I definitely</p>
  <p time="771279" is_ac="true">am going to bring the favorites with me</p>
  <p time="772920" is_ac="true">just on the journey into town and maybe</p>
  <p time="775279" is_ac="true">I might fall into a cafe I always tend</p>
  <p time="776920" is_ac="true">to slip and fall into a cafe that is my</p>
  <p time="778720" is_ac="true">plan today I would definitely love to</p>
  <p time="780160" is_ac="true">finish the favorites I think I will also</p>
  <p time="781760" is_ac="true">bring near to the wild heart with me</p>

  <p time="791079" is_ac="true">book I don't even is it called wild eyes</p>
  <p time="792959" is_ac="true">no I think that's the third one I don't</p>
  <p time="794680" is_ac="true">know what that one is called but I know</p>

  <p time="1026559" is_ac="true">finishing the favorites last night you</p>
  <p time="1028120" is_ac="true">would have seen my reaction I sobbed</p>

  <p time="1032079" is_ac="true">a book I love this so much more than I</p>
  <p time="1033959" is_ac="true">was anticipating don't get me wrong I</p>
  <p time="1035439" is_ac="true">was expecting to love it especially</p>
  <p time="1036760" is_ac="true">after hearing comparisons to Daisy Jones</p>
  <p time="1038520" is_ac="true">in the six and Magnolia Parks but oh my</p>
  <p time="1040520" is_ac="true">god did it exceed all my expectations</p>
  <p time="1042240" is_ac="true">and I was reading this over the course</p>
  <p time="1043799" is_ac="true">of quite a while like I want to say 2</p>
  <p time="1045679" is_ac="true">weeks maybe and I feel like had I had</p>
  <p time="1047439" is_ac="true">Bing dread this I would have loved to</p>
  <p time="1048960" is_ac="true">even more but that's quite hard because</p>
  <p time="1050440" is_ac="true">I did end up rating this five star this</p>
  <p time="1052600" is_ac="true">is my second five star of the year I am</p>
  <p time="1054600" is_ac="true">so so happy about it and I literally</p>
  <p time="1057000" is_ac="true">woke up this morning thinking about</p>
  <p time="1058320" is_ac="true">these characters in the ending I adored</p>
  <p time="1059960" is_ac="true">this for so many reasons I absolutely</p>
  <p time="1061679" is_ac="true">loved these characters to my core I</p>
  <p time="1064400" is_ac="true">loved the messiness did I want to throw</p>
  <p time="1066320" is_ac="true">my book at the wall at least 10 times</p>
  <p time="1068240" is_ac="true">last night yeah oh my God the anger that</p>
  <p time="1069880" is_ac="true">this book made me feel was insane but I</p>
  <p time="1071720" is_ac="true">feel that that's the whole point of</p>
  <p time="1072720" is_ac="true">reading like if an author can get that</p>
  <p time="1074520" is_ac="true">actual reaction out of me then they've</p>
  <p time="1076360" is_ac="true">done a really great job at writing the</p>
  <p time="1077720" is_ac="true">book and oh my God this was just so good</p>
  <p time="1079559" is_ac="true">I absolutely loved Katarina in this I</p>
  <p time="1081280" is_ac="true">actually think she's one of my favorite</p>
  <p time="1082600" is_ac="true">main characters female main characters</p>
  <p time="1084120" is_ac="true">that I've read from in a really really</p>
  <p time="1085840" is_ac="true">long time I loved all of her bitchiness</p>
  <p time="1087960" is_ac="true">and her messiness and her wit I just</p>
  <p time="1090080" is_ac="true">loved her so much here I'm going to talk</p>
  <p time="1091960" is_ac="true">about this book forever as I said at the</p>
  <p time="1093360" is_ac="true">beginning of this Vlog obviously this</p>
  <p time="1094960" is_ac="true">was my February book club book of the</p>
  <p time="1097039" is_ac="true">month so I have an entire spoiler filled</p>
  <p time="1099240" is_ac="true">reading Vlog over on my patreon for it</p>
  <p time="1101280" is_ac="true">so if you do want to see my actual</p>
  <p time="1102600" is_ac="true">reactions to so many different scenes</p>
  <p time="1104400" is_ac="true">and me actually sobbing at the end and</p>
  <p time="1106400" is_ac="true">all of those thoughts then definitely</p>
  <p time="1107880" is_ac="true">check out my patreon so yesterday with</p>
  <p time="1109520" is_ac="true">the favorites I read 212 pages and then</p>
  <p time="1111760" is_ac="true">I also listened to a bit of an audio bir</p>
  <p time="1113679" is_ac="true">and that one is how high we go in the</p>
  <p time="1115120" is_ac="true">dark this has been on my TBR for so long</p>
  <p time="1117039" is_ac="true">this is absolutely a festar prediction I</p>
  <p time="1118919" is_ac="true">don't know still if it's feeling like a</p>
  <p time="1120880" is_ac="true">five star currently but it is such an</p>
  <p time="1122520" is_ac="true">interesting read and as I said it's been</p>
  <p time="1124039" is_ac="true">on my TBR for ages I do believe it's one</p>
  <p time="1125840" is_ac="true">of my 25 books for 2025 I feel like I'm</p>
  <p time="1128280" is_ac="true">getting through them so quickly this</p>
  <p time="1130080" is_ac="true">book is so unique it's essentially short</p>
  <p time="1131799" is_ac="true">stories but as opposed to having short</p>
  <p time="1133200" is_ac="true">stories that literally have nothing to</p>
  <p time="1134559" is_ac="true">do with one another every short story is</p>
  <p time="1136559" is_ac="true">interconnected you're spanning</p>
  <p time="1138039" is_ac="true">Generations over the course of a century</p>
  <p time="1140000" is_ac="true">and I love things like that I love</p>
  <p time="1141760" is_ac="true">anything that is interconnected and</p>
  <p time="1143400" is_ac="true">spans that long of a period of time</p>
  <p time="1145600" is_ac="true">especially in a book like this when it's</p>
  <p time="1147280" is_ac="true">talking about a virus and like climate</p>
  <p time="1149360" is_ac="true">catastrophe I just love that commentary</p>
  <p time="1151120" is_ac="true">in literature so much and I feel like</p>
  <p time="1152600" is_ac="true">this is going to do it amazingly this</p>
  <p time="1153919" is_ac="true">one is counted as a Sci-Fi and I very</p>
  <p time="1156039" is_ac="true">very rarely read sci-fi I feel like the</p>
  <p time="1157880" is_ac="true">only Sci-Fi that I sort of love is</p>
  <p time="1159840" is_ac="true">dystopians and I suppose this one could</p>
  <p time="1161760" is_ac="true">slot into that but we are essentially</p>
  <p time="1163280" is_ac="true">following this virus that melts from</p>
  <p time="1164880" is_ac="true">this permafrost and we are just</p>
  <p time="1166320" is_ac="true">following the absolute catastrophe that</p>
  <p time="1168840" is_ac="true">comes with all of that and all of the</p>
  <p time="1170520" is_ac="true">human reactions and the way that it</p>
  <p time="1172320" is_ac="true">affects everyone's relationships to one</p>
  <p time="1173840" is_ac="true">another and their Dynamics it's</p>
  <p time="1175120" is_ac="true">definitely a pandemic story which if you</p>
  <p time="1177200" is_ac="true">don't like that after Co maybe don't</p>
  <p time="1179080" is_ac="true">read it it is so unique and the writing</p>
  <p time="1180799" is_ac="true">style is amazing I'm in the middle of</p>
  <p time="1182320" is_ac="true">the third story so I think I read about</p>
  <p time="1184440" is_ac="true">30 pages of this but I am listening to</p>
  <p time="1186200" is_ac="true">the audio book but I think it did equate</p>
  <p time="1187919" is_ac="true">to 30 pages I am really really enjoying</p>
  <p time="1189640" is_ac="true">this so far I'm really excited to see</p>
  <p time="1190960" is_ac="true">where it carries on reading but for the</p>
  <p time="1192440" is_ac="true">plans today I don't know if I even said</p>

  <p time="1265679" is_ac="true">reading is probably going to be</p>
  <p time="1266799" is_ac="true">significantly less than it has been the</p>
  <p time="1268400" is_ac="true">past couple of days because I'm planning</p>
  <p time="1269720" is_ac="true">on spending the entire day outside the</p>
  <p time="1271720" is_ac="true">weather is so nice it is still really</p>
  <p time="1273240" is_ac="true">really cold don't get me wrong but it's</p>
  <p time="1274400" is_ac="true">so sunny and it has been so Sunny for</p>
  <p time="1276440" is_ac="true">the past couple of days and I feel like</p>
  <p time="1277720" is_ac="true">I'm coming back to life I feel like I'm</p>
  <p time="1279080" is_ac="true">defrosting so I don't want to be inside</p>
  <p time="1280799" is_ac="true">reading I'm going to bring a book</p>
  <p time="1281960" is_ac="true">outside instead but yesterday I did</p>
  <p time="1283799" is_ac="true">finish near to the Wild Heart by Clarice</p>
  <p time="1285640" is_ac="true">Le Spectre obviously this is my favorite</p>
  <p time="1287400" is_ac="true">book of all time so it was a obviously</p>
  <p time="1289320" is_ac="true">it was a five star as I already said</p>
  <p time="1291000" is_ac="true">this was my B monthly classic book club</p>
  <p time="1292840" is_ac="true">for my patreon and I am just so happy</p>
  <p time="1295039" is_ac="true">that I got the opportunity to reread</p>
  <p time="1296440" is_ac="true">this again or to read it again I love</p>
  <p time="1298240" is_ac="true">this book so much I endlessly think the</p>
  <p time="1300080" is_ac="true">way that clis LE Spectre writes about</p>
  <p time="1301840" is_ac="true">life and love and girlhood and just</p>
  <p time="1304799" is_ac="true">having such an innate desire to be loved</p>
  <p time="1306799" is_ac="true">especially in this book Joanna as a</p>
  <p time="1308320" is_ac="true">protagonist is one that is so real and</p>
  <p time="1310679" is_ac="true">so raw and is so flawed and I just</p>
  <p time="1313120" is_ac="true">resonate with her so much and I just</p>
  <p time="1315320" is_ac="true">love this book so much I actually take a</p>
  <p time="1316840" is_ac="true">shot every single time I say that but I</p>
  <p time="1318279" is_ac="true">do feel like the first time that I read</p>
  <p time="1319880" is_ac="true">this it was 2 years ago I do feel like</p>
  <p time="1321559" is_ac="true">rereading this for the first time I had</p>
  <p time="1323720" is_ac="true">a bit of a different experience which is</p>
  <p time="1325520" is_ac="true">always so nice when you love a book so</p>
  <p time="1327279" is_ac="true">fondly and then you reread it again and</p>
  <p time="1329440" is_ac="true">you love it just as much but for</p>
  <p time="1330720" is_ac="true">different reasons and that was exactly</p>
  <p time="1332159" is_ac="true">my experience with this there really</p>
  <p time="1333480" is_ac="true">isn't anything new that I can say about</p>
  <p time="1334919" is_ac="true">this that I haven't already told you</p>
  <p time="1336200" is_ac="true">guys before because we know it's my</p>
  <p time="1337440" is_ac="true">favorite book of all time we know I love</p>
  <p time="1338679" is_ac="true">claresa Spectre but I finished that I</p>
  <p time="1340320" is_ac="true">think I read about 100 Pages yesterday</p>
  <p time="1342200" is_ac="true">and whilst I was out I did also listen</p>
  <p time="1343720" is_ac="true">to a little bit more of How High we go</p>
  <p time="1345559" is_ac="true">in the dark but really not that much at</p>
  <p time="1347200" is_ac="true">all I didn't even finish entire short</p>
  <p time="1348960" is_ac="true">story so the main cocs of my reading</p>
  <p time="1350320" is_ac="true">yesterday was near to the wild heart but</p>
  <p time="1351720" is_ac="true">as I said it is Saturday today I'm going</p>
