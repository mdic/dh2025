  <p time="40" is_ac="false">here are 17 things I wish I knew before I visitedÂ 
China I've just arrived back from traveling ChinaÂ Â </p>
  <p time="5640" is_ac="false">for a month and I've combined a list of allÂ 
the must nows and surprises that I faced whilstÂ Â </p>
  <p time="10760" is_ac="false">traveling through this secretive [Music] countryÂ 
let's waste no time and start with number one andÂ Â </p>
  <p time="20520" is_ac="false">that is you must bring your passport wherever youÂ 
go in China and before actually Landing in theÂ Â </p>
  <p time="25400" is_ac="false">country I didn't realize this but it's actually aÂ 
legal requirement to bring a passport you're goingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="30240" is_ac="false">to need it for all types of things whether you'reÂ 
booking attractions whether you're booking trainsÂ Â </p>
  <p time="35320" is_ac="false">everything kind of in China requires ID especiallyÂ 
when you're traveling on trains you're goingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="39360" is_ac="false">to actually have to scan your passport in theÂ 
automatic barriers and even if you're just poppingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="43840" is_ac="false">out to the convenience store technically you stillÂ 
need to bring your passport and one thing to noteÂ Â </p>
  <p time="48680" is_ac="false">they never accept a photocopy now number two isÂ 
Google Maps does not actually work in China nowÂ Â </p>
  <p time="55240" is_ac="false">if you've got a VPN which I'll talk about laterÂ 
it does kind of work but obviously no one usesÂ Â </p>
  <p time="60280" is_ac="false">it so it's not very useful things are out of dateÂ 
and most things aren't even on there now the appsÂ Â </p>
  <p time="66120" is_ac="false">you can use are Apple Maps and maps.me these workÂ 
relatively well but it's not what the Chinese useÂ Â </p>
  <p time="72680" is_ac="false">the Chinese use apps like Baidu maps and honestlyÂ 
we had it and it's so confusing everything's inÂ Â </p>
  <p time="79320" is_ac="false">Chinese number three is all about safety now a lotÂ 
of people worry about is it safety to go to ChinaÂ Â </p>
  <p time="84880" is_ac="false">but I felt incredibly safe as safe as I've everÂ 
felt anywhere probably safer than London and thereÂ Â </p>
  <p time="90840" is_ac="false">are cameras everywhere but as long as you're notÂ 
doing anything wrong I really don't see a problemÂ Â </p>
  <p time="95800" is_ac="false">with it now even my partner Amelia was sayingÂ 
is how safe she felt even when she was walkingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="100600" is_ac="false">around by herself China is safe fourth on the listÂ 
is make sure you have travel insurance when you'reÂ Â </p>
  <p time="106520" is_ac="false">going to China or wherever you may be going inÂ 
the world for over 2 years now I've been usingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="111640" is_ac="false">SafetyWing as my travel insurance provider whilstÂ 
I go abroad and they are the partners of today'sÂ Â </p>
  <p time="117040" is_ac="false">video whether we were camping on the Great WallÂ 
of China or hiking in the mountains of ZhangjiajieÂ Â </p>
  <p time="122240" is_ac="false">we were comforted knowing that if anythingÂ 
went wrong we will be covered with safe doingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="126600" is_ac="false">under safe doing policy you get covered for manyÂ 
different things whilst you are traveling and oneÂ Â </p>
  <p time="131720" is_ac="false">of the great benefits which I love as a digitalÂ 
Nomad is your flights home are actually coveredÂ Â </p>
  <p time="136840" is_ac="false">if something bad happens such as a family memberÂ 
passing away obviously touch would nothing likeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="142560" is_ac="false">this ever happens but as a no myself I know thisÂ 
is a potential unexpected cost I can just avoid byÂ Â </p>
  <p time="148680" is_ac="false">being covered with safety as you probably know IÂ 
spend a long time abroad away from home and everyÂ Â </p>
  <p time="154520" is_ac="false">two or three times a year I love to go home andÂ 
see my family see my friends and just catch up andÂ Â </p>
  <p time="159520" is_ac="false">with SafetyWiing you're actually covered for tripsÂ 
home whilst you're in your home country for up toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="164200" is_ac="false">30 days or 15 days as a US citizen for every 90Â 
days which you travel abroad and obviously safetyÂ Â </p>
  <p time="170680" is_ac="false">R covers you from medical expenses such as gettingÂ 
sick or injured and that's why I highly recommendÂ Â </p>
  <p time="175720" is_ac="false">clicking the top Link in the description to getÂ 
yourself covered on your next trip go get yourselfÂ Â </p>
  <p time="180640" is_ac="false">covered and let's move on to number five which isÂ 
use DD DD is an application you get on your phoneÂ Â </p>
  <p time="187520" is_ac="false">and it's basically the Chinese equivalent of UberÂ 
or grab and it is super affordable probably moreÂ Â </p>
  <p time="193560" is_ac="false">affordable than like grab in Indonesia or grabÂ 
in Thailand I was amazed and you can practicallyÂ Â </p>
  <p time="199640" is_ac="false">get them anywhere I think every place we visit inÂ 
China over a month there was DDS whenever you wantÂ Â </p>
  <p time="205520" is_ac="false">you can just call a DD and it would literallyÂ 
arrive in a couple of minutes there must be soÂ Â </p>
  <p time="209520" is_ac="false">many Now using the DD app is really simple it'sÂ 
just like uber and it's in English which is a veryÂ Â </p>
  <p time="215320" is_ac="false">important thing if you don't speak any ChineseÂ 
it's going to make things much easier than tryingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="220040" is_ac="false">to speak to taxi drivers over translation appsÂ 
and stuff download DD if you don't speak ChineseÂ Â </p>
  <p time="225520" is_ac="false">it's going to be your Lifesaver number six is youÂ 
need mobile data whilst you're in China uh mobileÂ Â </p>
  <p time="232840" is_ac="false">data is used for loads of stuff like WeChat alipayÂ 
looking up stuff using translation apps just trustÂ Â </p>
  <p time="238760" is_ac="false">me especially if you don't speak Chinese you'reÂ 
going to need mobile data now what I did was getÂ Â </p>
  <p time="244600" is_ac="false">an eim because eims are so much easier because youÂ 
can get them before you even enter the country andÂ Â </p>
  <p time="250320" is_ac="false">the two eim providers that I kind of use is ollyÂ 
and AO Olly is more like an unlimited data plansÂ Â </p>
  <p time="256360" is_ac="false">and you can kind of choose how long you're in theÂ 
country and just get unlimited data I'll leaveÂ Â </p>
  <p time="260360" is_ac="false">both of those in the description if you want toÂ 
get one of those before you travel to China nowÂ Â </p>
  <p time="264320" is_ac="false">the other benefit to using an eim which I didn'tÂ 
even realize before setting foot in China is thatÂ Â </p>
  <p time="269720" is_ac="false">and eim kind of works as a VPN because it's basedÂ 
in like Hong Kong or Singapore or just anotherÂ Â </p>
  <p time="275960" is_ac="false">country outside of China you can kind of stillÂ 
access Google Instagram Facebook all that kindÂ Â </p>
  <p time="280920" is_ac="false">of stuff as long as you're not on like a Wi-Fi aÂ 
local Wi-Fi network logged into your hosel Wi-FiÂ Â </p>
  <p time="288040" is_ac="false">that's not going to work as a VPN you're goingÂ 
to need another VPN which I'll explain later onÂ Â </p>
  <p time="292280" is_ac="false">number seven getting around China was one of theÂ 
best and easiest things and fastest things thatÂ Â </p>
  <p time="297920" is_ac="false">I've ever done now if you didn't realize China isÂ 
actually I think bigger land area than the UnitedÂ Â </p>
  <p time="304000" is_ac="false">States so it's a huge it's a massive countryÂ 
and the great thing about China is they haveÂ Â </p>
  <p time="309640" is_ac="false">the high-speed super fast trains and this meansÂ 
getting around the whole country is super fastÂ Â </p>
  <p time="314920" is_ac="false">super easy and fairly affordable compared toÂ 
flights the great thing about using the trainsÂ Â </p>
  <p time="319800" is_ac="false">rather than flights is you can just turn up 30Â 
minutes beforehand jump on a high-speed train andÂ Â </p>
  <p time="324120" is_ac="false">you'll be supersonic sped to your next destinationÂ 
all the trains seem very modern like we wereÂ Â </p>
  <p time="330960" is_ac="false">really impressed with the trains even like moreÂ 
modern than the ones in Japan because they've beenÂ Â </p>
  <p time="335480" is_ac="false">built more recently and the network connecting allÂ 
the high-speed trains around China is actually theÂ Â </p>
  <p time="341200" is_ac="false">largest in the world by a country mile so whereverÂ 
you want to go you've probably got a high-speedÂ Â </p>
  <p time="346560" is_ac="false">train going there we booked all our highspeedÂ 
trains on trip.com and I'll leave a link to thatÂ Â </p>
  <p time="351840" is_ac="false">in the description I know there's a lot of linksÂ 
but trust me you're going to need these links allÂ Â </p>
  <p time="356040" is_ac="false">in the description which I'll lay out because it'sÂ 
just going to help you book and and plan your tripÂ Â </p>
  <p time="360680" is_ac="false">to China now number eight when to go on your tripÂ 
to China now there's definitely some times whichÂ Â </p>
  <p time="365400" is_ac="false">I would advise to go and other times maybe I wouldÂ 
avoid traveling China for example on bank holidaysÂ Â </p>
  <p time="371560" is_ac="false">and Chinese holidays it is going to be superÂ 
busy traveling we were in Shanghai last yearÂ Â </p>
  <p time="377640" is_ac="false">during the summer holidays and I've never seen soÂ 
many people in my life it was just packs it wasÂ Â </p>
  <p time="384520" is_ac="false">packed Chinese new year is going to be super busyÂ 
maybe just avoid it or just go for the experienceÂ Â </p>
  <p time="390040" is_ac="false">so July and August is not really a great timeÂ 
to go as everyone's on their summer holidaysÂ Â </p>
  <p time="394480" is_ac="false">now great time to travel China where the crowdsÂ 
aren't too big it's not too hot it's not tooÂ Â </p>
  <p time="399120" is_ac="false">cold is May to June and September and OctoberÂ 
these are like the shoulder months and kind ofÂ Â </p>
  <p time="404080" is_ac="false">are the real sweet spots of when you should visitÂ 
China we kind of went in June and it started toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="409640" is_ac="false">get busier towards the end and honestly itÂ 
got a little bit hot so may would probablyÂ Â </p>
  <p time="414400" is_ac="false">be your sweet spot maybe October if you'reÂ 
going in the fall now number nine China isÂ Â </p>
  <p time="419760" is_ac="false">different culture it's very different from lotsÂ 
of other places you'll travel maybe a little bitÂ Â </p>
  <p time="423800" is_ac="false">similar to Vietnam and the Far East but it isÂ 
different things like Q jumping was a big thingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="430080" is_ac="false">we were a little bit shocked at times people wouldÂ 
just cut in front of you and wouldn't even realizeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="434520" is_ac="false">you're there uh the other things is like spittingÂ 
in public is a very common thing we were veryÂ Â </p>
  <p time="439480" is_ac="false">shocked walking through cities people are spittingÂ 
everywhere I think it's just something to do withÂ Â </p>
  <p time="443800" is_ac="false">the Chinese medicine and clearing your throatÂ 
or whatever but it was a little bit of a shockÂ Â </p>
  <p time="448280" is_ac="false">and it's just like okay okay wasn't expecting thatÂ 
but that's how they do it in China number 10 let'sÂ Â </p>
  <p time="454120" is_ac="false">talk about visas because visas are a big thingÂ 
which puts off a lot of people from traveling toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="460120" is_ac="false">China but recently China have just released theseÂ 
countries right here a 15 day visa-free travel toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="467880" is_ac="false">mainland China so this means if you're from theseÂ 
countries you get 15 days where you don't have toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="472360" is_ac="false">do any paperwork whatsoever however if you're notÂ 
from one of these countries and you're from the UKÂ Â </p>
  <p time="477680" is_ac="false">or the us then there is a lot of paperwork theseÂ 
are the two wges of paper which we need for ourÂ Â </p>
  <p time="483600" is_ac="false">Chinese visa and you have to go to a ChineseÂ 
visa center we went to the one in London andÂ Â </p>
  <p time="487960" is_ac="false">there's actually four different centers over theÂ 
UK so luckily you don't just have to travel toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="492760" is_ac="false">the capital city we applied for a 30-day touristÂ 
visa and they actually came back and gave us aÂ Â </p>
  <p time="497160" is_ac="false">2-year multi-entry visa for up to 90 days so maybeÂ 
they're just being really lenient with visas atÂ Â </p>
  <p time="503120" is_ac="false">the moment but just go for the 30-day visa and seeÂ 
what you get yes the Visa process is long and TIÂ Â </p>
  <p time="509600" is_ac="false">and you have to book all your hotels in advanceÂ 
B your return ticket but trust me it's going toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="514720" is_ac="false">be worth it your trip to China will be incredibleÂ 
now pause there for one moment we are just overÂ Â </p>
  <p time="520320" is_ac="false">the halfway mark and if this video has providedÂ

  <p time="534080" is_ac="false">go hit it and let's move on now number 11 isÂ 
about the subway systems and the subway systemÂ Â </p>
  <p time="539440" is_ac="false">systems are in lots of major cities in China andÂ 
they're very similar to Subway systems in EuropeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="546000" is_ac="false">or Singapore or the us or wherever you are fromÂ 
so it's going to be very simple to use and theÂ Â </p>
  <p time="550880" is_ac="false">great thing is they are in English so the signsÂ 
are in English and the announcements are also inÂ Â </p>
  <p time="556520" is_ac="false">English so you don't speak Chinese you're goingÂ 
to be fine now one thing to remember because weÂ Â </p>
  <p time="562200" is_ac="false">got confused is that once they translate it fromÂ 
the Chinese characters to the like the English wayÂ Â </p>
  <p time="568520" is_ac="false">of spelling stuff a lot of the stations are veryÂ 
very similar look at all the letters and just makeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="573800" is_ac="false">sure that they match where you're trying to go cuzÂ 
some stations are really similar so we ended up aÂ Â </p>
  <p time="578560" is_ac="false">couple of times going to a different station whichÂ 
had a very similar name to the station we wereÂ Â </p>
  <p time="583000" is_ac="false">trying to go to number 12 is about the food so inÂ 
China they kind of did it a little bit differentÂ Â </p>
  <p time="587960" is_ac="false">in some restaurants and you'd order food for likeÂ 
the table or your group that you were in you putÂ Â </p>
  <p time="592520" is_ac="false">it in the middle and then you kind of share andÂ 
you can try like little different bits we didn'tÂ Â </p>
  <p time="596840" is_ac="false">realize that at first but we kind of got to theÂ 
and was kind of seeing what other people wereÂ Â </p>
  <p time="601080" is_ac="false">doing just try loads of food was here in ChinaÂ 
cuz we were impressed at how good the food wasÂ Â </p>
  <p time="606040" is_ac="false">and it was also super affordable too especiallyÂ 
once we get to the South outside of Beijing andÂ Â </p>
  <p time="610400" is_ac="false">Shanghai the big cities stuff especially foodÂ 
gets cheaper surprisingly they actually haveÂ Â </p>
  <p time="615640" is_ac="false">loads of McDonald's loads of Starbucks loads ofÂ 
KFCs everywhere in China there's probably moreÂ Â </p>
  <p time="620560" is_ac="false">of those chains than I've seen anywhere else inÂ 
the world I haven't really been to the US much soÂ Â </p>
  <p time="625480" is_ac="false">maybe they've got more there probably number 13 isÂ 
get a good translation app because you're going toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="630920" is_ac="false">need this all of the time if you don't speak muchÂ 
Chinese or don't speak any Chinese whatsoever justÂ Â </p>
  <p time="636080" is_ac="false">like us you're going to be translating all thingsÂ 
like screenshots on applications uh taking photosÂ Â </p>
  <p time="641560" is_ac="false">of menus just talking to people to buy a bottleÂ 
of water if you don't speak any Chinese pleaseÂ Â </p>
  <p time="647360" is_ac="false">don't let this put you off traveling China becauseÂ 
it's easily to get around and the Chinese are veryÂ Â </p>
  <p time="651720" is_ac="false">Nimble and quick to use the translation apps evenÂ 
on their phones to help you out number 14 let'sÂ Â </p>
  <p time="657440" is_ac="false">talk about vpns now if you want access things likeÂ 
Google or Instagram Facebook any social media orÂ Â </p>
  <p time="663760" is_ac="false">even just general websites that's going to beÂ 
practically impossible in China because they areÂ Â </p>
  <p time="668440" is_ac="false">banned however using a VPN is how you bypassÂ 
this and you can still access these networksÂ Â </p>
  <p time="674600" is_ac="false">but the thing you need to remember is you needÂ 
to get a VPN before you enter China otherwiseÂ Â </p>
  <p time="679960" is_ac="false">the likelihood of getting a VPN is going to beÂ 
very difficult because obviously vpns are bannedÂ Â </p>
  <p time="685120" is_ac="false">in China as well I've been using SurfsharkÂ 
for a few years and they're always my go-toÂ Â </p>
  <p time="689440" is_ac="false">VPN partner however I've heard things that AstrillÂ 
is like the best VPN to use whilst you're in ChinaÂ Â </p>
  <p time="696000" is_ac="false">it is a lot more expensive than surf shark butÂ 
if you're just going to China for a month maybeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="700960" is_ac="false">just get a one month pass I'll leave a link toÂ 
it in the description one thing to remember isÂ Â </p>
  <p time="706160" is_ac="false">China are always trying to block these differentÂ 
IP addresses from abroad to stop people accessingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="710560" is_ac="false">Google and all these networks but what youÂ 
can do is just change your IP address changeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="715600" is_ac="false">the country your virtual country which you areÂ 
located in for example change a location fromÂ Â </p>
  <p time="720880" is_ac="false">London to New York and hopefully that will beÂ 
able to bypass the great firewall of China nowÂ Â </p>
  <p time="727040" is_ac="false">number 15 is something we didn't actually face butÂ 
other people were telling us about this if you'reÂ Â </p>
  <p time="731800" is_ac="false">staying in an apartment or a small hotel or guestÂ 
house and they're not used to taking InternationalÂ Â </p>
  <p time="736840" is_ac="false">tourists then you actually have to register withÂ 
the local police normally the hotel or hostel willÂ Â </p>
  <p time="742000" is_ac="false">do this for you but in some small cases you'reÂ 
going to have to register yourself and I thinkÂ Â </p>
  <p time="747360" is_ac="false">you just have to go to the police station but whatÂ 
my recommendation is is book International hostelsÂ Â </p>
  <p time="752760" is_ac="false">book international hotels and you won't have toÂ 
do this and it'll just save you a lot of timeÂ Â </p>
  <p time="757920" is_ac="false">number 16 is how to pay in China because it'sÂ 
very different from other countries they don'tÂ Â </p>
  <p time="762760" is_ac="false">really use international debit and credit cardsÂ 
and they actually use QR payments with WeChatÂ Â </p>
  <p time="768400" is_ac="false">and alipay these are the two most common waysÂ 
of paying I would highly recommend setting upÂ Â </p>
  <p time="773000" is_ac="false">WeChat and alipay before you set foot in ChinaÂ 
because sometimes you have to verify with yourÂ Â </p>
  <p time="777200" is_ac="false">phone number and you might not be able to accessÂ 
the verification code with your number when you'reÂ Â </p>
  <p time="782440" is_ac="false">in China so just get it set up before you startÂ 
your trip once or twice our alipay and we chatÂ Â </p>
  <p time="787360" is_ac="false">would not go through and for some reason it wouldÂ 
not work so we always made sure we had some backupÂ Â </p>
  <p time="792440" is_ac="false">Cash Cash isn't that common but most places stillÂ 
accept cash you just have to ask them can I pay inÂ Â </p>
  <p time="798800" is_ac="false">cash or just show them cash because you're usingÂ 
QR payments which uses your phone you're goingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="803120" is_ac="false">to need to make sure your phone is always chargedÂ 
and there's lots of power Banks which you can useÂ Â </p>
  <p time="808320" is_ac="false">throughout the cities and lots of differentÂ 
locations but also just make sure you've gotÂ Â </p>
  <p time="811640" is_ac="false">power bank on you so you can always charge itÂ 
up so you can pay for stuff and finally we areÂ Â </p>
  <p time="816840" is_ac="false">on to the final one and this is all about bookingÂ 
stuff booking attractions booking tickets bookingÂ Â </p>
  <p time="822360" is_ac="false">trains flights hotels all that kind of stuff nowÂ
