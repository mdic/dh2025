  <p time="0" is_ac="true">So for me it's all about music. The</p>
  <p time="5030" is_ac="true">most important thing for both results and music is a sense of rhythm.</p>
  <p time="9769" is_ac="true">Without rhythm you can't cook a good meal and you can't even do the 4th act. So</p>
  <p time="13570" is_ac="true">for me, music is nothing.</p>
  <p time="29740" is_ac="true">[Music] It</p>
  <p time="52290" is_ac="true">was about 40 years ago when I ate pizza for the first time in Naples. The</p>
  <p time="59180" is_ac="true">first thing I thought when I ate it for the first time was that it had a very nostalgic taste. It</p>
  <p time="65500" is_ac="true">was very memorable.</p>
  <p time="68020" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="69650" is_ac="true">But I still</p>
  <p time="72740" is_ac="true">felt that it had a very historical feel to it, but it also felt very close to me.</p>
  <p time="79870" is_ac="true">That was what inspired me to</p>
  <p time="81600" is_ac="true">make pizza. The</p>
  <p time="88020" is_ac="true">history of pizza in Japan is very long.</p>
  <p time="92350" is_ac="true">As I mentioned in the previous issue, there</p>
  <p time="96670" is_ac="true">were pizza makers in the 1950s. At that time, people from Naples made pizza in Japan directly,</p>
  <p time="103330" is_ac="true">but then Japanese people started coming in as well.</p>
  <p time="111110" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="118300" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="124970" is_ac="true">Well, when I started, more than 20 years ago, there weren't many good things in Japan,</p>
  <p time="131090" is_ac="true">but now the logistics have improved and there are a lot of imports,</p>
  <p time="137390" is_ac="true">so we can</p>
  <p time="139350" is_ac="true">get a lot of great products. We try to buy</p>
  <p time="142300" is_ac="true">things that are available in Japan as much as possible.</p>
  <p time="144560" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="146180" is_ac="true">But the oil and tomatoes are from</p>
  <p time="151099" is_ac="true">Italy, and the cheese is from Italy.</p>
  <p time="157240" is_ac="true">In particular, the</p>
  <p time="158860" is_ac="true">cheese comes from Italy.  I</p>
  <p time="161640" is_ac="true">think it's important to use the latest pitter patter. It's</p>
  <p time="173890" is_ac="true">very difficult to say which shape is best, and I try to perfect it</p>
  <p time="178020" is_ac="true">myself.</p>
  <p time="182690" is_ac="true">[Music] It</p>
  <p time="201190" is_ac="true">'s a food dish, so it's all done with a bang, and I</p>
  <p time="206800" is_ac="true">fiddle around with the texture. It's baked</p>
  <p time="211080" is_ac="true">in the oven for</p>
  <p time="213640" is_ac="true">one to one and a half minutes.</p>
  <p time="217870" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
  <p time="222240" is_ac="true">When I decided to study the actual situation, I</p>
  <p time="225750" is_ac="true">went to Naples, of course,</p>
  <p time="228450" is_ac="true">but I couldn't study there. It's very difficult, and there are</p>
  <p time="231230" is_ac="true">very few</p>
  <p time="235420" is_ac="true">restaurants that will accept a foreigner, for example a Japanese person, so I studied on my own. It's like I'm</p>
  <p time="244780" is_ac="true">taught. It's</p>
  <p time="246750" is_ac="true">quite difficult, and even now I haven't reached the perfect shape for myself</p>
  <p time="252190" is_ac="true">as a food.</p>
  <p time="263880" is_ac="true">[Music]</p>
