  <p time="5262" is_ac="false">if your preferred language is not English</p>
  <p time="6752" is_ac="false">good morning everyone welcome to the channel</p>
  <p time="9332" is_ac="false">recently China has reopened its borders</p>
  <p time="12092" is_ac="false">and I've also got a lot of questions in a backstage </p>
  <p time="15504" is_ac="false">asking me about the traveling advice in China</p>
  <p time="18004" is_ac="false">some of the very commonly asked questions </p>
  <p time="22005" is_ac="false">include for example </p>
  <p time="24005" is_ac="false">I don't speak Chinese or my Chinese isn't good </p>
  <p time="27006" is_ac="false">is it difficult to travel in China</p>
  <p time="28139" is_ac="false">I am a vegetarian vegan or</p>
  <p time="32007" is_ac="false">muslim I'm worried about the food</p>
  <p time="35108" is_ac="false"> do you have any recommendations for mobile phone apps in China</p>
  <p time="39120" is_ac="false"> is it hard to move around how the public 
transport how to book tickets how about the  </p>
  <p time="45540" is_ac="false">hotel cost how to book hotel rooms can you fly 
the drones isn't it illegal so I've decided to  </p>
  <p time="53340" is_ac="false">make this video and help you to navigate 
your trips in China especially for those  </p>
  <p time="58200" is_ac="false">who wants to travel independently and also for 
a longer time this video has two parts in the  </p>
  <p time="64740" is_ac="false">first part I will address some of the most 
commonly asked questions and in the second  </p>
  <p time="70740" is_ac="false">part I will give you some personal advice 
especially for first time visitors</p>
  <p time="81900" is_ac="false">[Music] as to the English level in big cities in China for 
example Beijing Shanghai chengdu Guangzhou</p>
  <p time="87987" is_ac="false">it's very easy to find English-speaking young people</p>
  <p time="90977" is_ac="false">but in more remote part of China in rural China</p>
  <p time="94564" is_ac="false">it's hard so remember that you have a 
Google translate on your phone</p>
  <p time="99954" is_ac="false">and you can pull it out anytime or you have a question</p>
  <p time="103298" is_ac="false">but don't be intimidated by the language barrier</p>
  <p time="107732" is_ac="false">because Chinese people most of them 
are very helpful</p>
  <p time="111488" is_ac="false">they are willing to help so with the help of a translator</p>
  <p time="115255" is_ac="false">I'm sure that most of your questions will get answered</p>
  <p time="124740" is_ac="false">there is a list of apps that will make you travel in China</p>
  <p time="128824" is_ac="false">much easier and I will go through them one by one</p>
  <p time="132159" is_ac="false">VPN</p>
  <p time="136149" is_ac="false">if you want to access for example Gmail Google YouTube Instagram Facebook</p>
  <p time="141818" is_ac="false">then you really need a VPN on your phone</p>
  <p time="144430" is_ac="false">the most commonly used one include for example expressvn nordvpn</p>
  <p time="150916" is_ac="false">so feel free to choose which 
one suits you</p>
  <p time="154000" is_ac="false">personally I have a shadow rocket on my iPhone</p>
  <p time="157806" is_ac="false">I don't know how it works a friend 
helped to set it up for me</p>
  <p time="161793" is_ac="false">but make sure that you have this VPN service ready before entering China</p>
  <p time="167145" is_ac="false">otherwise it's going to be very difficult to even download a VPN app on your phone</p>
  <p time="172579" is_ac="false">once you are in China</p>
  <p time="173873" is_ac="false">translating apps such as Google translate or Wiggles are completely necessary</p>
  <p time="179033" is_ac="false">and also you need WeChat widgets like a Chinese version of WhatsApp</p>
  <p time="184698" is_ac="false">but comes with more functions</p>
  <p time="186529" is_ac="false">and it's a most common way to connect to communicate with Chinese people</p>
  <p time="192153" is_ac="false">so it also comes with a mobile payment function you can link your International credit card</p>
  <p time="201041" is_ac="false">with a WeChat account</p>
  <p time="202633" is_ac="false">and this allows you to pay in for example in a supermarket to the street vendors</p>
  <p time="208786" is_ac="false">to buy tickets Etc so WeChat it's 
definitely a must in China</p>
  <p time="214646" is_ac="false">alipay is another it's another useful Mobile payment app</p>
  <p time="219117" is_ac="false">but I found WeChat it's more useful</p>
  <p time="222361" is_ac="false">especially when you are paying to Street vendors</p>
  <p time="224607" is_ac="false">more people accept WeChat payment compared with alipay</p>
  <p time="228905" is_ac="false">map apps</p>
  <p time="233040" is_ac="false">you will also need a map app there are two choices</p>
  <p time="236209" is_ac="false">either Baidu app or gaode map both are standard Chinese map</p>
  <p time="241313" is_ac="false">they are more accurate compared with apple map or Google Map</p>
  <p time="245808" is_ac="false">but they're only in Chinese however as long as you type in pinyin</p>
  <p time="250923" is_ac="false">the spelling of the place names</p>
  <p time="253297" is_ac="false">those apps will recognize it </p>
  <p time="256501" is_ac="false">personally I don't really use a app for metros</p>
  <p time="259403" is_ac="false">I use Gaode map instead</p>
  <p time="261261" is_ac="false">however this Metro man China has English version</p>
  <p time="264982" is_ac="false">so it's very friendly for foreign tourists foreign</p>
  <p time="270540" is_ac="false">travel service apps</p>
  <p time="272700" is_ac="false">there are three apps that you can use for online travel services</p>
  <p time="276630" is_ac="false">to book a hotel to buy tickets to rent a car Etc</p>
  <p time="279515" is_ac="false">and they are trip. which is 
International Version</p>
  <p time="283903" is_ac="false">and it's in English and Ctrip and Qunar</p>
  <p time="287150" is_ac="false">citrip and Qunar are in Chinese</p>
  <p time="289710" is_ac="false">they are domestic versions but they are more powerful</p>
  <p time="293640" is_ac="false">for those who doesn't speak Chinese then trip is the best app</p>
  <p time="297099" is_ac="false">because you can book hotel rooms train tickets flights</p>
  <p time="301071" is_ac="false">rent a car and also in China not all hotels accept foreign visitors</p>
  <p time="307856" is_ac="false">because some of them don't have the 
qualification</p>
  <p time="310481" is_ac="false">however all the hotels that you can find on trip</p>
  <p time="314352" is_ac="false">have this qualification so you can book hotel</p>
  <p time="317829" is_ac="false">through trip without worrying too much</p>
  <p time="319829" is_ac="false">for those who understand chinese you can also</p>
  <p time="321829" is_ac="false">the more powerful version of Qunar and Ctrip</p>
  <p time="326267" is_ac="false">those two apps are quite similar</p>
  <p time="328434" is_ac="false">they have more hotel choices</p>
  <p time="330463" is_ac="false">and they also allow you to book bus tickets online</p>
  <p time="333561" is_ac="false">which is not available on trip however, when booking hotel rooms</p>
  <p time="337800" is_ac="false">remember to tick the criteria</p>
  <p time="340228" is_ac="false">适用外宾（shi-yong-wai-bing）</p>
  <p time="341912" is_ac="false">which means foreign visitors accepted</p>
  <p time="344513" is_ac="false">so that you can chose from hotels that</p>
  <p time="347362" is_ac="false">have the qualification to host foreign visitors</p>
  <p time="351180" is_ac="false">personally as a Chinese citizen I use qunar </p>
  <p time="354792" is_ac="false">more often because I found the hotel price</p>
  <p time="358035" is_ac="false">on Qunar is slightly cheaper compared with Ctrip</p>
  <p time="362480" is_ac="false">although it's the same room same Hotel</p>
  <p time="365318" is_ac="false">hotel accommodation</p>
  <p time="369120" is_ac="false">hotel accommodation in China is not very expensive</p>
  <p time="372027" is_ac="false">in big cities like Shanghai and Beijing</p>
  <p time="374419" is_ac="false">a standard hotel room would cost in between</p>
  <p time="377394" is_ac="false">30 to 40 US dollars</p>
  <p time="379556" is_ac="false">and in smaller cities the price would be around</p>
  <p time="382224" is_ac="false">20 US Dollars</p>
  <p time="383755" is_ac="false">and my personal traveling budget for hotel rooms</p>
  <p time="387531" is_ac="false">is 15 US Dollars and I end up often paying something</p>
  <p time="391780" is_ac="false">around 70 or 80 Yuan so this is my hotel room</p>
  <p time="396343" is_ac="false">just to show you it's not very fancy</p>
  <p time="399030" is_ac="false">but it's good enough although not all Hotels accept foreign visitors</p>
  <p time="404316" is_ac="false">you still have plenty of choices for example</p>
  <p time="407169" is_ac="false">all the star hotels or the chain Budget Hotels</p>
  <p time="409883" is_ac="false">as well as all the hostels accept foreigners</p>
  <p time="413580" is_ac="false">how is public transportation, is it hard to reach smaller places</p>
  <p time="419051" is_ac="false">as to Transportation China has perhaps the world's best public transportation system</p>
  <p time="424958" is_ac="false">it's very easy to move around it's affordable and it's very efficient</p>
  <p time="429221" is_ac="false">so most of the big cities have train stations</p>
  <p time="433004" is_ac="false">and for smaller cities without train 
station</p>
  <p time="435780" is_ac="false">you can go there by buses</p>
  <p time="437838" is_ac="false">and within the city there is always buses</p>
  <p time="440881" is_ac="false">and you can also take taxis and in smaller cities</p>
  <p time="444347" is_ac="false">sometimes they are informal rickshaws that you can you can use</p>
  <p time="449267" is_ac="false">and the price is often cheaper than taking the taxi</p>
  <p time="453822" is_ac="false">for very long distance travel for example</p>
  <p time="456859" is_ac="false">from Beijing to kunming from Beijing to Guizhou</p>
  <p time="460533" is_ac="false">I would recommend that you travel by air because</p>
  <p time="463035" is_ac="false">sometimes the flight tickets are much cheaper than the railway tickets</p>
  <p time="468734" is_ac="false">and it's much faster</p>
  <p time="470072" is_ac="false">all the flights train tickets bus tickets</p>
  <p time="472813" is_ac="false">can be booked through trip but in remote places in China</p>
  <p time="476583" is_ac="false">sometimes there are other ways of Local transportation</p>
  <p time="480785" is_ac="false">that are not really available 
through C-trip</p>
  <p time="483957" is_ac="false">so I highly recommend that you check with your hotel reception</p>
  <p time="488282" is_ac="false">because sometimes there are private shared taxis</p>
  <p time="492368" is_ac="false">or local shuttle buses and they can always help you</p>
  <p time="496579" is_ac="false">to plan your trip and that's also what I do very often</p>
  <p time="501780" is_ac="false">I am vegan/ vegetarian/ muslim</p>
  <p time="506581" is_ac="false">China has a long and profound food culture that</p>
  <p time="508760" is_ac="false">almost every Chinese is so proud of</p>
  <p time="511777" is_ac="false">there is little reason for you to worry about the food</p>
  <p time="514926" is_ac="false">because whether you are vegan muslim or vegetarian</p>
  <p time="518682" is_ac="false">you have plenty of choices</p>
  <p time="520367" is_ac="false">I'm pretty confident that you you will 
have a lot of fun discovering new dishes</p>
  <p time="525591" is_ac="false">and me as a native Chinese</p>
  <p time="527751" is_ac="false">I am also discovering new food</p>
  <p time="530393" is_ac="false">in every place that I travel to</p>
  <p time="538400" is_ac="false">filming and drone use</p>
  <p time="539400" is_ac="false">as to filming and drone use China is actually a very camera friendly country</p>
  <p time="545381" is_ac="false">most people don't mind to be photographed</p>
  <p time="547769" is_ac="false">but try to avoid taking pictures of for example</p>
  <p time="551469" is_ac="false">policeman, of soldiers, when you go through the Custom</p>
  <p time="555701" is_ac="false">Security check</p>
  <p time="557255" is_ac="false">as to drone use all the drones must be registered with your identification card</p>
  <p time="563743" is_ac="false">or passport but this website is only in Chinese</p>
  <p time="567845" is_ac="false">and you need a Chinese mobile phone number</p>
  <p time="570516" is_ac="false">so if you want to use 
the drones remember</p>
  <p time="572831" is_ac="false">to ask some Chinese friend to help you with that to register that drone first</p>
  <p time="578934" is_ac="false">in general flying a drone is very relaxed in China</p>
  <p time="582795" is_ac="false">but some cities are stricter for example 
in the capital city of Beijing</p>
  <p time="587168" is_ac="false">and also in terms of some big public events</p>
  <p time="591178" is_ac="false">sometimes you have to 
pre-register with the local police station</p>
  <p time="595925" is_ac="false">but otherwise in most touristic attractions</p>
  <p time="598964" is_ac="false">and also in rural area you're free to fly the Drone</p>
  <p time="602944" is_ac="false">As Long as You Follow the local regulation</p>
  <p time="605993" is_ac="false">okay now let's enter the second part my traveling advice</p>
  <p time="616680" is_ac="false">get prepared for the Chinese stare if 
you are foreign looking</p>
  <p time="620628" is_ac="false">Chinese people are very curious towards foreign tourists</p>
  <p time="623617" is_ac="false">so sometimes they stare at you for a long time</p>
  <p time="626833" is_ac="false">don't worry they don't mean 
anything</p>
  <p time="629777" is_ac="false">they just do it out of curiosity</p>
  <p time="637140" is_ac="false">so whenever you need help you can always 
ask for example policeman Hotel reception  </p>
  <p time="643800" is_ac="false">passengers on the street and believe me 
most Chinese people despite the language  </p>
  <p time="649860" is_ac="false">barrier they are very willing to help 
you to solve the problem foreign</p>
  <p time="654436" is_ac="false">be careful with tourists scammers</p>
  <p time="658620" is_ac="false">unfortunately there are tourist scammers in very 
popular touristic area so don't buy  </p>
  <p time="668100" is_ac="false">expensive jewelry don't buy expensive tea 
in touristic area and also be careful of  </p>
  <p time="674160" is_ac="false">those who are approaching you and offer 
you taxi ride hotel rooms because it's  </p>
  <p time="680880" is_ac="false">very likely that it will be overpriced 
so if you are not very sure about those  </p>
  <p time="686040" is_ac="false">services please please ask again, staff who 
is working in the train station ask the shop  </p>
  <p time="692640" is_ac="false">owners for more local information and to 
avoid unnecessary Financial loss</p>
  <p time="698560" is_ac="false">embrace chinese hospitality</p>
  <p time="704460" is_ac="false">my next tip is to embrace Chinese Hospitality to 
my experience Chinese people are very similar to  </p>
  <p time="711240" is_ac="false">for example Turkish Iranians Malaysians 
we like to offer other people free food  </p>
  <p time="716640" is_ac="false">free drinks and don't be surprised if you get 
a dinner invitation when meet someone for  </p>
  <p time="724980" is_ac="false">the first time it's our deep rooted tradition 
to extend our warmth to foreign visitors so  </p>
  <p time="732300" is_ac="false">if you're open enough you will make some very 
good experiences and make some local friends</p>
  <p time="742820" is_ac="false">avoid traveling in certain time</p>
  <p time="743820" is_ac="false">there are a certain time that you should try 
to avoid traveling in China for example the  </p>
  <p time="749760" is_ac="false">first week of May and also of October that's 
our national holiday everyone wants to travel  </p>
  <p time="756360" is_ac="false">there will be a lot of traffic everything will be 
much more expensive another time that is not so  </p>
  <p time="763320" is_ac="false">good to travel is the Spring Festival because 
that's the time when everyone goes back home  </p>
  <p time="769920" is_ac="false">and the shops will be closed but besides 
that China is a big country that you can  </p>
  <p time="776460" is_ac="false">find Pleasant places to visit almost at any 
time of the year so that's it I hope all my  </p>
  <p time="784860" is_ac="false">information will help you to plan your trips 
in China and if you have any other questions  </p>
  <p time="789960" is_ac="false">you can also leave a comment and finally 
welcome to China and enjoy your trip</p>
