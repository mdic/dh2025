  <p time="1839" is_ac="true">changes that you need to know as we head</p>
  <p time="3560" is_ac="true">into 2024 some of these changes and</p>
  <p time="5920" is_ac="true">updates are predictions for 2024 some of</p>
  <p time="8320" is_ac="true">them have been reported on by Instagram</p>
  <p time="10040" is_ac="true">CEO himself and some of them are coming</p>
  <p time="12480" is_ac="true">from some recent studies that have been</p>
  <p time="13920" is_ac="true">done into Instagram where we are looking</p>
  <p time="15719" is_ac="true">at the actual data to let you know what</p>
  <p time="18320" is_ac="true">is working what is not working and what</p>
  <p time="19880" is_ac="true">is going to be working in</p>
  <p time="23359" is_ac="true">2024 in case You' never watched any of</p>
  <p time="25560" is_ac="true">my content before hello my name is Brock</p>
  <p time="27279" is_ac="true">Johnson and it's my job to help you grow</p>
  <p time="29160" is_ac="true">on Instagram I've grown my own personal</p>
  <p time="30679" is_ac="true">following to over 600,000 followers over</p>
  <p time="32719" is_ac="true">the course of the last few years and</p>
  <p time="34239" is_ac="true">I've been really blessed to now speak on</p>
  <p time="35800" is_ac="true">stages around the world and even consult</p>
  <p time="37640" is_ac="true">with meta Facebook and Instagram on some</p>
  <p time="39520" is_ac="true">of their new features the first change</p>
  <p time="41280" is_ac="true">that I want to report to you as we head</p>
  <p time="42640" is_ac="true">into 2024 is that reals are no longer</p>
  <p time="45640" is_ac="true">King Instagram in 2022 was all about</p>
  <p time="48360" is_ac="true">reals and in 2023 we started to see a</p>
  <p time="51039" is_ac="true">shift because of a wide variety of</p>
  <p time="52600" is_ac="true">things first and foremost is supply and</p>
  <p time="55120" is_ac="true">demand because everyone in their mom and</p>
  <p time="57960" is_ac="true">their Grandma started posting reels</p>
  <p time="59640" is_ac="true">there was a massive influx of Supply in</p>
  <p time="62600" is_ac="true">fact according to one study done by</p>
  <p time="64040" is_ac="true">metrial that looked at over 1 million</p>
  <p time="67159" is_ac="true">Instagram reels they found that the</p>
  <p time="69799" is_ac="true">average account was posting between 30</p>
  <p time="72119" is_ac="true">and 90% more reels in 2023 quite simply</p>
  <p time="75880" is_ac="true">put there's a lot more reels being</p>
  <p time="77439" is_ac="true">posted now than there was in the past</p>
  <p time="79880" is_ac="true">but when you look at demand which is</p>
  <p time="81680" is_ac="true">essentially how much attention is being</p>
  <p time="83600" is_ac="true">given to Instagram or how much time are</p>
  <p time="86280" is_ac="true">people spending on Instagram we haven't</p>
  <p time="88560" is_ac="true">necessarily seen a big increase and in</p>
  <p time="90520" is_ac="true">many studies we even see a slight</p>
  <p time="92320" is_ac="true">decrease in terms of how much time</p>
  <p time="94200" is_ac="true">people are spending per month on</p>
  <p time="95799" is_ac="true">Instagram so if people are spending the</p>
  <p time="97680" is_ac="true">same amount of time on Instagram yet</p>
  <p time="99320" is_ac="true">we're expecting them to consume 30 to</p>
  <p time="101360" is_ac="true">90% more reals of course reals views are</p>
  <p time="104479" is_ac="true">going to go down that market is a lot</p>
  <p time="106560" is_ac="true">more saturated if you were someone who</p>
  <p time="108240" is_ac="true">is posting reels in 2021 you were going</p>
  <p time="110840" is_ac="true">to most likely have wild success back</p>
  <p time="113680" is_ac="true">then it was realistic to say hey if</p>
  <p time="115600" is_ac="true">you're posting 30 reels in 30 days at</p>
  <p time="117920" is_ac="true">least one of those is going to go viral</p>
  <p time="119880" is_ac="true">and help you gain a lot of followers but</p>
  <p time="122280" is_ac="true">now not only is it a lot tougher to go</p>
  <p time="124079" is_ac="true">viral it's also a lot tougher to convert</p>
  <p time="125840" is_ac="true">those viewers into followers and that's</p>
  <p time="127920" is_ac="true">because as the quality of content</p>
  <p time="129640" is_ac="true">continues to increase as more people are</p>
  <p time="131840" is_ac="true">creating reels and as the average</p>
  <p time="133520" is_ac="true">Instagram user is consuming more reels</p>
  <p time="136080" is_ac="true">they're less likely to just follow</p>
  <p time="137760" is_ac="true">anyone who makes a good re or makes a</p>
  <p time="140120" is_ac="true">funny reel and in fact according to a</p>
  <p time="142000" is_ac="true">study done by metrol in 20123 Real's</p>
  <p time="145239" is_ac="true">views are on average down by</p>
  <p time="148480" is_ac="true">76% and I hear it every single day in</p>
  <p time="151040" is_ac="true">the DM people are messaging me saying I</p>
  <p time="153200" is_ac="true">used to get 100,000 views on every reel</p>
  <p time="155239" is_ac="true">now I'm getting 10,000 I used to get</p>
  <p time="156760" is_ac="true">10,000 views on every re now I'm getting</p>
  <p time="158720" is_ac="true">a th000 I used to get 1,000 views on</p>
  <p time="160200" is_ac="true">every reel and now I can barely get a</p>
  <p time="162000" is_ac="true">100 and I know it's frustrating</p>
  <p time="163519" is_ac="true">especially because a lot of us are</p>
  <p time="164680" is_ac="true">spending a lot of time creating these</p>
  <p time="167120" is_ac="true">reals ultimately for them to not perform</p>
  <p time="168959" is_ac="true">very well but the facts are the facts</p>
  <p time="171000" is_ac="true">and the numbers show us that Real's</p>
  <p time="173200" is_ac="true">views are down Real's engagement is down</p>
  <p time="175680" is_ac="true">and so one of my biggest predictions one</p>
  <p time="177640" is_ac="true">of the biggest algorithm changes as we</p>
  <p time="179440" is_ac="true">head into 2024 is that it's not just all</p>
  <p time="182319" is_ac="true">about reals so if when you take a look</p>
  <p time="184120" is_ac="true">at your Instagram profile it's 100%</p>
  <p time="186760" is_ac="true">reals or even just majority reels I want</p>
  <p time="189560" is_ac="true">you to reconsider that strategy as we</p>
  <p time="192000" is_ac="true">move forward the second biggest</p>
  <p time="193599" is_ac="true">algorithm change that I can tell you as</p>
  <p time="195120" is_ac="true">we head into this new year will help you</p>
  <p time="197080" is_ac="true">get more views on your reels and that is</p>
  <p time="199239" is_ac="true">that the hook is everything I would</p>
  <p time="201360" is_ac="true">recommend spending 80% of your time</p>
  <p time="203400" is_ac="true">Focus energy and effort when you're</p>
  <p time="205360" is_ac="true">creating content on the hook for those</p>
  <p time="208159" is_ac="true">of you who don't know what a hook is a</p>
  <p time="209760" is_ac="true">Hook is essentially the beginning of</p>
  <p time="211599" is_ac="true">your content whether that's the first</p>
  <p time="213480" is_ac="true">line of your caption the first few</p>
  <p time="215400" is_ac="true">seconds of your video the first slide in</p>
  <p time="217760" is_ac="true">your Carousel or the headline let's say</p>
  <p time="220159" is_ac="true">if you're creating an infographic the</p>
  <p time="222080" is_ac="true">beginning of something is your hook and</p>
  <p time="224040" is_ac="true">it's called The Hook because it's meant</p>
  <p time="225360" is_ac="true">to hook in your audience right it's</p>
  <p time="227159" is_ac="true">meant to grab their attention and make</p>
  <p time="229040" is_ac="true">sure they're watching just like at the</p>
  <p time="230480" is_ac="true">beginning of this YouTube video if you</p>
  <p time="232000" is_ac="true">rewind back to the very start I used a</p>
  <p time="234120" is_ac="true">hook to hopefully draw you in and get</p>
  <p time="236000" is_ac="true">you watching up until the point that you</p>
  <p time="237400" is_ac="true">are right now but one of the big issues</p>
  <p time="239120" is_ac="true">with Instagram reals is so many</p>
  <p time="240879" is_ac="true">Instagram coaches say post valuable</p>
  <p time="243239" is_ac="true">content make sure your content is great</p>
  <p time="245040" is_ac="true">make sure you're giving valuable tips</p>
  <p time="246840" is_ac="true">and sharing great information but the</p>
  <p time="249000" is_ac="true">problem is even the greatest most</p>
  <p time="251560" is_ac="true">valuable book ever written won't be read</p>
  <p time="254840" is_ac="true">if it doesn't have a strong opening</p>
  <p time="256720" is_ac="true">chapter if each chapter doesn't have a</p>
  <p time="258720" is_ac="true">strong opening paragraph if the title</p>
  <p time="260959" is_ac="true">and the cover of the book aren't going</p>
  <p time="263080" is_ac="true">to hook readers in and actually make</p>
  <p time="264639" is_ac="true">them want to read it doesn't matter how</p>
  <p time="266680" is_ac="true">great your movie is if the first 15</p>
  <p time="269280" is_ac="true">minutes suck you're going to get a bunch</p>
  <p time="270960" is_ac="true">of people walking out of the movie so</p>
  <p time="272840" is_ac="true">yes the rising action the storytelling</p>
  <p time="275080" is_ac="true">the climax the resolution all those</p>
  <p time="276600" is_ac="true">things matter but ultimately they're a</p>
  <p time="278560" is_ac="true">waste of time if you don't start with a</p>
  <p time="280560" is_ac="true">strong hook Mr Beast even once reported</p>
  <p time="282840" is_ac="true">that he spends about</p>
  <p time="284000" is_ac="true">$10,000 per YouTube thumbnail and that</p>
  <p time="286800" is_ac="true">might sound crazy to a lot of people but</p>
  <p time="289039" is_ac="true">essentially the thumbnail on YouTube is</p>
  <p time="291360" is_ac="true">the first hook that is the first</p>
  <p time="293400" is_ac="true">opportunity that you have on YouTube to</p>
  <p time="295720" is_ac="true">grab someone's attention and get them to</p>
  <p time="297320" is_ac="true">watch your video so he could spend</p>
  <p time="299080" is_ac="true">millions of of dollars making amazing</p>
  <p time="300759" is_ac="true">videos and ultimately the views are</p>
  <p time="302479" is_ac="true">going to be way lower if his hook AKA</p>
  <p time="305360" is_ac="true">his title and his thumbnail aren't high</p>
  <p time="307479" is_ac="true">enough quality and on Instagram</p>
  <p time="308880" is_ac="true">fortunately you don't have to spend</p>
  <p time="309960" is_ac="true">$110,000 creating this amazing thumbnail</p>
  <p time="312360" is_ac="true">and I know that there are covers on</p>
  <p time="314080" is_ac="true">Instagram reals don't get me wrong but</p>
  <p time="316039" is_ac="true">let's also be honest very few people are</p>
  <p time="317759" is_ac="true">even going to be looking at your cover</p>
  <p time="319639" is_ac="true">so really the hook that matters on</p>
  <p time="321520" is_ac="true">Instagram is the beginning of the</p>
  <p time="323720" is_ac="true">content itself unfortunately we actually</p>
  <p time="326000" is_ac="true">recently did a study deep diving into</p>
  <p time="328440" is_ac="true">about 300 different Instagram posts that</p>
  <p time="331160" is_ac="true">have gone viral we were looking at the</p>
  <p time="332840" is_ac="true">most popular viral reels and studying</p>
  <p time="335919" is_ac="true">specifically their hooks we were looking</p>
  <p time="337639" is_ac="true">at what Hooks were performing the best</p>
  <p time="339479" is_ac="true">what sorts of languaging were people</p>
  <p time="341120" is_ac="true">using were people focused on negative</p>
  <p time="343199" is_ac="true">outcomes positive outcomes was there</p>
  <p time="344960" is_ac="true">some sort of like key word that everyone</p>
  <p time="346759" is_ac="true">was using and we put together a top 25</p>
  <p time="349639" is_ac="true">list and we decided to make that free so</p>
  <p time="351680" is_ac="true">down below in the show notes or in the</p>
  <p time="353400" is_ac="true">description below this episode you can</p>
  <p time="355280" is_ac="true">find the link to our 25 viral Instagram</p>
  <p time="358639" is_ac="true">hooks even while while you're listening</p>
  <p time="359960" is_ac="true">to this right now or if you're watching</p>
  <p time="361080" is_ac="true">on YouTube I highly recommend clicking</p>
  <p time="362880" is_ac="true">on that link it'll open in another</p>
  <p time="364400" is_ac="true">browser and you can just pop in your</p>
  <p time="365720" is_ac="true">email so that you get those viral hooks</p>
  <p time="367759" is_ac="true">while you're still listening to or</p>
  <p time="369360" is_ac="true">watching this in the background</p>
  <p time="370960" is_ac="true">definitely check that out but we created</p>
  <p time="372759" is_ac="true">that in the first place and decided to</p>
  <p time="374280" is_ac="true">even do that study because the hook is</p>
  <p time="376639" is_ac="true">just so so important if you don't have a</p>
  <p time="379280" is_ac="true">quality hook even the best content won't</p>
  <p time="381599" is_ac="true">get watched and in a day and age where</p>
  <p time="383639" is_ac="true">everyone's attention span is getting</p>
  <p time="384880" is_ac="true">shorter and shorter and we're getting</p>
  <p time="386160" is_ac="true">used to these really really brief videos</p>
  <p time="388599" is_ac="true">and these super quick vertical reels and</p>
  <p time="391280" is_ac="true">Tik toks and things like that if you're</p>
  <p time="393199" is_ac="true">not grabbing someone's attention</p>
  <p time="395000" is_ac="true">immediately like in the first few frames</p>
  <p time="397199" is_ac="true">of the video they're going to scroll</p>
  <p time="398840" is_ac="true">away and all of the rest of the effort</p>
  <p time="400319" is_ac="true">that you put in was kind of for waste</p>
  <p time="402120" is_ac="true">and so as we head into 2024 I want you</p>
  <p time="404360" is_ac="true">to revisit all of the reels that you've</p>
  <p time="407000" is_ac="true">posted in 2023 especially the reels that</p>
  <p time="409080" is_ac="true">you thought would do really well and</p>
  <p time="410199" is_ac="true">ended up not doing so great revisit them</p>
  <p time="412720" is_ac="true">and specifically look with a critical</p>
  <p time="414840" is_ac="true">eye at Your Hooks is there something</p>
  <p time="417280" is_ac="true">visually grabbing people's attention at</p>
  <p time="418800" is_ac="true">the beginning is there a sound effect is</p>
  <p time="420800" is_ac="true">there an edit is there a transition what</p>
  <p time="423039" is_ac="true">kinds of words what's your opening</p>
  <p time="424560" is_ac="true">phrase or statement and is it really</p>
  <p time="426319" is_ac="true">going to grab the attention of a</p>
  <p time="428440" is_ac="true">stranger who's just scrolling through</p>
  <p time="430520" is_ac="true">Instagram and my Pro tip for you is that</p>
  <p time="432240" is_ac="true">if you had a reel in 2023 that you're</p>
  <p time="433960" is_ac="true">like this should have done well I put a</p>
  <p time="435520" is_ac="true">lot of work into this I don't know why</p>
  <p time="437039" is_ac="true">this didn't perform so good post it</p>
  <p time="439240" is_ac="true">again in 2024 but change out the hook</p>
  <p time="442440" is_ac="true">see if you can use one of the hooks from</p>
  <p time="444080" is_ac="true">our 25 viral hooks guide and maybe swap</p>
  <p time="447639" is_ac="true">out just the beginning of that video who</p>
  <p time="449599" is_ac="true">cares if you're wearing a different</p>
  <p time="450560" is_ac="true">shirt or if your hair looks a little bit</p>
  <p time="452199" is_ac="true">longer in the new video swap out the</p>
  <p time="454319" is_ac="true">hook and I bet you that video will</p>
  <p time="456039" is_ac="true">perform better and you won't have to put</p>
  <p time="457800" is_ac="true">in the whole effort to re-recording or</p>
  <p time="459520" is_ac="true">remaking the entire video the third</p>
  <p time="461360" is_ac="true">algorithm change that I want you to be</p>
  <p time="462560" is_ac="true">aware of as we head into 2024 is that</p>
  <p time="465520" is_ac="true">carousels and photos are back baby the</p>
  <p time="468479" is_ac="true">initial uh inclination that this was</p>
  <p time="470759" is_ac="true">happening I know it's a big word uh the</p>
  <p time="472680" is_ac="true">initial idea that this was going to</p>
  <p time="474759" is_ac="true">happen came from Instagram CEO in the</p>
  <p time="477360" is_ac="true">summer of 2022 surprisingly when he said</p>
  <p time="481319" is_ac="true">quote I think we went too far with</p>
  <p time="483840" is_ac="true">pushing reals he was basically saying I</p>
  <p time="486120" is_ac="true">think we at Instagram with the Instagram</p>
  <p time="488840" is_ac="true">algorithm went overboard with the</p>
  <p time="491080" is_ac="true">distribution and the view share of reals</p>
  <p time="494039" is_ac="true">because of course with let's say 100</p>
  <p time="496560" is_ac="true">million people on Instagram every day</p>
  <p time="498400" is_ac="true">the algorithm has to decide who is</p>
  <p time="500400" is_ac="true">seeing what and what percentage of reals</p>
  <p time="502280" is_ac="true">are being pushed and what percentage of</p>
  <p time="504240" is_ac="true">the feed is reals versus photos versus</p>
  <p time="506479" is_ac="true">carousels and basically the CEO Adam</p>
  <p time="508759" is_ac="true">masery on his Instagram story said we</p>
  <p time="511159" is_ac="true">went too far so in the future we're</p>
  <p time="513320" is_ac="true">going to be balancing it out we're going</p>
  <p time="515320" is_ac="true">to be balancing out the reach between</p>
  <p time="517599" is_ac="true">reals and non-real so of course there is</p>
  <p time="520560" is_ac="true">the whole Supply demand thing and that's</p>
  <p time="522279" is_ac="true">one of the big reasons that reals views</p>
  <p time="524039" is_ac="true">are down but another big reason why</p>
  <p time="525560" is_ac="true">Real's views are down is simply because</p>
  <p time="527640" is_ac="true">of this internal change this algorithm</p>
  <p time="530160" is_ac="true">shift at Instagram where they have now</p>
  <p time="532160" is_ac="true">made a point of emphasis to make sure</p>
  <p time="534399" is_ac="true">that non-real AKA photos and carousels</p>
  <p time="537680" is_ac="true">are getting more views they're getting</p>
  <p time="539200" is_ac="true">getting more distribution so let's hold</p>
  <p time="541040" is_ac="true">that in our mind and now let's also</p>
  <p time="542399" is_ac="true">think about the whole supply and demand</p>
  <p time="544200" is_ac="true">thing if the supply of photos and</p>
  <p time="547320" is_ac="true">carousels is down because everyone is</p>
  <p time="549440" is_ac="true">busy posting reals plus you add that in</p>
  <p time="551360" is_ac="true">with the fact that demand is technically</p>
  <p time="553079" is_ac="true">increasing because the algorithm is</p>
  <p time="554680" is_ac="true">showing photos and carousels to more</p>
  <p time="556519" is_ac="true">people you have the inverse of what</p>
  <p time="558560" is_ac="true">happened with reals happening with</p>
  <p time="560160" is_ac="true">photos and carousels in other words</p>
  <p time="562560" is_ac="true">you're going to get more views and</p>
  <p time="564120" is_ac="true">engagement on your photos and carousels</p>
  <p time="566680" is_ac="true">in 2024 than you likely did in 2022 or</p>
  <p time="570120" is_ac="true">even in 2023 in fact according to that</p>
  <p time="572160" is_ac="true">study that I mentioned earlier that came</p>
  <p time="573680" is_ac="true">out at the end of 2023 photos are</p>
  <p time="576720" is_ac="true">getting more engagement in 2023 than</p>
  <p time="579360" is_ac="true">they were in 2022 and carousels which I</p>
  <p time="582040" is_ac="true">know I've said that word a few times</p>
  <p time="583399" is_ac="true">that's like the slideshow posts those</p>
  <p time="585480" is_ac="true">posts are not only getting more</p>
  <p time="586920" is_ac="true">engagement in 2023 they're getting more</p>
  <p time="590240" is_ac="true">reach they're reaching more people and</p>
  <p time="591839" is_ac="true">getting more views this year than they</p>
  <p time="593720" is_ac="true">were last year and we expect that Trend</p>
  <p time="595720" is_ac="true">to continue into 2024 this is something</p>
  <p time="598519" is_ac="true">that we actually recently did an entire</p>
  <p time="600120" is_ac="true">insta clubhub live training on so if</p>
  <p time="602079" is_ac="true">you're an insta clubhub member make sure</p>
  <p time="603839" is_ac="true">to log into the club and check out those</p>
  <p time="605480" is_ac="true">recent live trainings cuz we did an</p>
  <p time="606760" is_ac="true">entire live training not just on the</p>
  <p time="609079" is_ac="true">fact that carousels and photos are back</p>
  <p time="611720" is_ac="true">but also we talked about how you can use</p>
  <p time="613440" is_ac="true">your past reels to create nonre and</p>
  <p time="615839" is_ac="true">different strategies for creating more</p>
  <p time="617680" is_ac="true">content on Instagram that's actually</p>
  <p time="619440" is_ac="true">going to perform well so make sure you</p>
  <p time="620720" is_ac="true">log in and check that out algorithm</p>
  <p time="622360" is_ac="true">update number four for 2024 is that</p>
  <p time="624800" is_ac="true">shares are king and now we've been</p>
  <p time="627519" is_ac="true">saying this for quite a while for quite</p>
  <p time="629440" is_ac="true">a while there's been a myth floating</p>
  <p time="631200" is_ac="true">around on Instagram that saves are the</p>
  <p time="633279" is_ac="true">best form of Engagement according to our</p>
  <p time="635200" is_ac="true">own data research and according to</p>
  <p time="637279" is_ac="true">honestly common sense it doesn't really</p>
  <p time="639440" is_ac="true">make sense that a save would be the best</p>
  <p time="641040" is_ac="true">form of Engagement because let's think</p>
  <p time="642440" is_ac="true">about what is a save a save is</p>
  <p time="644040" is_ac="true">essentially someone just tapping on that</p>
  <p time="645560" is_ac="true">little bookmark and hoping or planning</p>
  <p time="648279" is_ac="true">that they're going to go back and</p>
  <p time="649360" is_ac="true">revisit your content in the future but</p>
  <p time="651360" is_ac="true">it doesn't necessarily generate more</p>
  <p time="652760" is_ac="true">views it doesn't necessarily guarantee</p>
  <p time="654279" is_ac="true">that that person is spending more time</p>
  <p time="655600" is_ac="true">on Instagram and it's kind of a a</p>
  <p time="657760" is_ac="true">lowlevel form of Engagement Eng agement</p>
  <p time="659519" is_ac="true">right it doesn't take a lot of</p>
  <p time="660600" is_ac="true">investment for the person who's pressing</p>
  <p time="662399" is_ac="true">save in order to save your post on the</p>
  <p time="664240" is_ac="true">other hand a share according to our</p>
  <p time="665680" is_ac="true">research equates to 400 additional views</p>
  <p time="669079" is_ac="true">just one share equates to on average 400</p>
  <p time="671519" is_ac="true">extra views on Instagram and so that in</p>
  <p time="674040" is_ac="true">and of itself tells us well yeah a share</p>
  <p time="676279" is_ac="true">is the best way to get more engagement</p>
  <p time="678240" is_ac="true">and more views and more followers Also</p>
  <p time="680720" is_ac="true">let's think about the intention behind</p>
  <p time="682360" is_ac="true">someone who is sharing they are quite</p>
  <p time="684040" is_ac="true">literally taking your content and</p>
  <p time="685680" is_ac="true">telling more people to look at it</p>
  <p time="687079" is_ac="true">whether they're sharing it on their</p>
  <p time="688079" is_ac="true">story sharing it in their group chat</p>
  <p time="689639" is_ac="true">sharing it via direct message it is</p>
  <p time="691639" is_ac="true">quite literally directly generating more</p>
  <p time="694160" is_ac="true">views it's that follower or that engager</p>
  <p time="696560" is_ac="true">saying this content is so good I want</p>
  <p time="699079" is_ac="true">more people to see it and we've been</p>
  <p time="701000" is_ac="true">saying this for the last few years but</p>
  <p time="703040" is_ac="true">finally Instagram's CEO Adam maery</p>
  <p time="705680" is_ac="true">directly said this on his Instagram</p>
  <p time="707560" is_ac="true">stories he reported that the best form</p>
  <p time="710040" is_ac="true">of Engagement from Instagram's</p>
  <p time="712160" is_ac="true">perspective is a share and he said this</p>
  <p time="714600" is_ac="true">because he said that shares generate the</p>
  <p time="717079" is_ac="true">most conversation and shares lead to</p>
  <p time="719279" is_ac="true">people spending more time on Instagram</p>
  <p time="721320" is_ac="true">so if you want to crush it on Instagram</p>
  <p time="723240" is_ac="true">in 2024 you want to make sure you're</p>
  <p time="725040" is_ac="true">getting more shares and how do you do</p>
  <p time="726639" is_ac="true">that well you create share worthy</p>
  <p time="728240" is_ac="true">content duh you create content that is</p>
  <p time="730600" is_ac="true">worthy of being shared generally</p>
  <p time="732680" is_ac="true">speaking there are a few different</p>
  <p time="734199" is_ac="true">categories of what is share worthy there</p>
  <p time="736240" is_ac="true">are a few different kinds of posts that</p>
  <p time="738199" is_ac="true">are more likely to get shares than</p>
  <p time="739720" is_ac="true">others and again I know I mentioned the</p>
  <p time="741160" is_ac="true">insta clubhub a minute ago that's</p>
  <p time="742519" is_ac="true">something that we detail in length</p>
  <p time="744160" is_ac="true">inside the insta clubhub but essentially</p>
  <p time="746360" is_ac="true">the primary forms of sharew worthy cont</p>
  <p time="748880" is_ac="true">content is number one thought-provoking</p>
  <p time="751279" is_ac="true">or emotional content number two</p>
  <p time="754160" is_ac="true">controversial content and number three</p>
  <p time="756279" is_ac="true">breaking news/ trending SL poop culture</p>
  <p time="759320" is_ac="true">content when you can create sharew</p>
  <p time="760920" is_ac="true">worthy content and thus get more shares</p>
  <p time="763120" is_ac="true">you will reliably reach more people</p>
  <p time="765279" is_ac="true">increase your engagement and grow your</p>
  <p time="766639" is_ac="true">following speaking of Engagement and</p>
  <p time="768160" is_ac="true">getting more views my fifth algorithm</p>
  <p time="770279" is_ac="true">change for Instagram as we head into</p>
  <p time="772040" is_ac="true">2024 is that for reals you should be</p>
  <p time="774120" is_ac="true">focused on watch rate or in other words</p>
  <p time="776680" is_ac="true">the percentage of the real that the</p>
  <p time="778880" is_ac="true">average person is watching if your reel</p>
  <p time="781160" is_ac="true">is 10 seconds long and the average</p>
  <p time="782760" is_ac="true">person watches 8 seconds then your watch</p>
  <p time="785399" is_ac="true">rate or your percentage completion is</p>
  <p time="787600" is_ac="true">80% so yes with this in mind it is true</p>
  <p time="790079" is_ac="true">that often times the shorter reels the</p>
  <p time="792320" is_ac="true">ones that are you know 10 seconds or</p>
  <p time="794120" is_ac="true">less they're going to have a higher</p>
  <p time="796120" is_ac="true">percentage of watch time people are</p>
  <p time="797560" is_ac="true">going to watch them 100% of the way</p>
  <p time="799639" is_ac="true">through or even 150% they're going to</p>
  <p time="801920" is_ac="true">watch the whole reel and they're going</p>
  <p time="803240" is_ac="true">to watch it again for 50% and that is a</p>
  <p time="806000" is_ac="true">great metric that is a great indication</p>
  <p time="808199" is_ac="true">for the algorithm to push your reel to</p>
  <p time="810560" is_ac="true">more people but I do want to remind you</p>
  <p time="812160" is_ac="true">that there is no silver bullet or magic</p>
  <p time="814240" is_ac="true">length your reels don't have to be 7</p>
  <p time="816120" is_ac="true">Seconds they don't have to be a minute</p>
  <p time="817600" is_ac="true">long they should be long enough to cover</p>
  <p time="820959" is_ac="true">what you need to cover but short enough</p>
  <p time="823279" is_ac="true">to hold people's attention one of our</p>
  <p time="824680" is_ac="true">insta Club of students calls that the</p>
  <p time="826279" is_ac="true">miniskirt Rule and I love calling it</p>
  <p time="828120" is_ac="true">that as well short enough to grab and</p>
  <p time="830199" is_ac="true">hold people's attention but still long</p>
  <p time="831639" is_ac="true">enough to cover what you need to cover</p>
  <p time="833320" is_ac="true">basically the biggest tip that I can</p>
  <p time="834600" is_ac="true">give you is to be concise to not mince</p>
  <p time="837079" is_ac="true">words to edit out any dead space or</p>
  <p time="839920" is_ac="true">pauses in your speaking and basically</p>
  <p time="841920" is_ac="true">and I know this is tough for some people</p>
  <p time="843040" is_ac="true">don't blabber on and try to stay as</p>
  <p time="844800" is_ac="true">brief as you can and with a new update</p>
  <p time="846480" is_ac="true">at the end of 2023 Instagram gave us the</p>
  <p time="849079" is_ac="true">ability to track watch time and see all</p>
  <p time="851440" is_ac="true">this data on watch rate and completion</p>
  <p time="853720" is_ac="true">percentage and average view duration and</p>
  <p time="855560" is_ac="true">total view duration and all that good</p>
  <p time="857079" is_ac="true">stuff so you're able to get a lot more</p>
  <p time="858720" is_ac="true">information on your reels after you've</p>
  <p time="861000" is_ac="true">posted them to see if people are</p>
  <p time="862800" is_ac="true">watching them all the way through and</p>
  <p time="864000" is_ac="true">you can use that to inform your future</p>

  <p time="868000" is_ac="true">prioritizing watch time and completion</p>
  <p time="870320" is_ac="true">percentage and then the sixth and final</p>
  <p time="872240" is_ac="true">algorithm change that I wanted to report</p>
  <p time="873880" is_ac="true">on for you for 2024 is that hashtags and</p>
  <p time="877360" is_ac="true">trending audios are far less important</p>
  <p time="880000" is_ac="true">and far less effective than they have</p>
  <p time="882040" is_ac="true">been in the past let's talk about</p>
  <p time="883519" is_ac="true">hashtags first and foremost there're</p>
  <p time="884800" is_ac="true">something I've talked about many many</p>
  <p time="886000" is_ac="true">times here on this channel detailed in</p>
  <p time="888240" is_ac="true">length but hashtags are just not as</p>
  <p time="890519" is_ac="true">effective now as they were in the past</p>
  <p time="892880" is_ac="true">in let's say 2015 2016 hashtags were</p>
  <p time="895519" is_ac="true">huge they were a great way to categorize</p>
  <p time="897959" is_ac="true">your content to get discovered to reach</p>
  <p time="899839" is_ac="true">new people and to reliably increase your</p>
  <p time="902160" is_ac="true">engagement but increasingly now as time</p>
  <p time="904360" is_ac="true">has gone on as more people have started</p>
  <p time="906399" is_ac="true">to use and even abuse hashtags and as</p>
  <p time="909279" is_ac="true">Instagram has increased their SEO</p>
  <p time="911759" is_ac="true">capabilities and decreased their</p>
  <p time="913480" is_ac="true">importance of hashtags or Reliance upon</p>
  <p time="916120" is_ac="true">hashtags they've just become a lot less</p>
  <p time="918279" is_ac="true">reliable of a way to grow your account</p>
  <p time="920759" is_ac="true">and get more engagement now don't get me</p>
  <p time="922399" is_ac="true">wrong they're not totally dead they're</p>
  <p time="923839" is_ac="true">not totally worthless they can still</p>
  <p time="926279" is_ac="true">help they can still uh you know allow to</p>
  <p time="928880" is_ac="true">reach more people or be discovered</p>
  <p time="930560" is_ac="true">they're not totally dead and worthless</p>
  <p time="932639" is_ac="true">but I don't think that hashtag</p>
  <p time="934600" is_ac="true">specifically should be an area of your</p>
  <p time="936959" is_ac="true">Instagram strategy that you're really</p>
  <p time="938399" is_ac="true">focused on or spending a lot of time</p>

  <p time="944040" is_ac="true">that they are related to your content</p>
  <p time="945639" is_ac="true">and you should be good to go now the</p>
  <p time="947000" is_ac="true">other area of this algorithm change is</p>
  <p time="949079" is_ac="true">trending audios trending Audios in 2022</p>
  <p time="952279" is_ac="true">were massive trending Audios in 2023</p>

  <p time="991319" is_ac="true">Instagram helps the person who is</p>

  <p time="996079" is_ac="true">overall I think that there has been an</p>
