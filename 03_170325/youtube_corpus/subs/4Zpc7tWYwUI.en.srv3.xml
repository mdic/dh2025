  <p time="148640" is_ac="false">breakfast we have to make it beautiful Rich No it's the most important meal of the day and in total for</p>
  <p time="155040" is_ac="false">this breakfast we spent 16,700 One which is around ‚Ç¨11 and let's go and prepare the American coffee</p>
  <p time="161080" is_ac="false">in the meantime In fact we have to prepare almost everything because everything needs to be heated and here it is a very</p>
  <p time="166800" is_ac="false">comfortable thing very Convenience they have a microwave they have boiling water there is a corner where</p>
  <p time="172520" is_ac="false">everything is available but you can only heat the things you have bought here not foods</p>
  <p time="177800" is_ac="false">bought from other places Ah ok ok Ok no problem he is afraid quite a bit that he will dirty the table But as</p>
  <p time="188920" is_ac="false">I am, even if it is dirty I also clean it with my shirt That is because of some people</p>
  <p time="193960" is_ac="false">who are not very civilized they are afraid first a person in front of him dropped a</p>
  <p time="199480" is_ac="false">water cap He didn't even pick this up Instead we have to put them in the microwave So first</p>
  <p time="204800" is_ac="false">of all we have to open the bag a little Now we can go and put them in the microwave</p>
  <p time="210200" is_ac="false">Let's see Ah it's helping me How nice</p>
  <p time="241160" is_ac="false">Wow I didn't know that I mean this thing is new to me he put the boiling water first and then</p>
  <p time="248000" is_ac="false">put it in the microwave for a minute However it's the first time I've seen a</p>
  <p time="252560" is_ac="false">very kind sales assistant because honestly I've noticed that the clerks here aren't the waiters are a little</p>
  <p time="258160" is_ac="false">cold Ok ok Wow</p>
  <p time="264880" is_ac="false">ready opp as well instant noodles very ready I think they are overcooked that is, come on they are hot they are</p>
  <p time="280560" is_ac="false">hot and here as you can see it's all self service people already from a young age start</p>
  <p time="291680" is_ac="false">combining things and knowing how to do things that is you become unconsciously independent</p>
  <p time="301560" is_ac="false">and the ingredient that gives that extra Koreanness is</p>
  <p time="306280" is_ac="false">banana milk Oh well what a stuff Let's go and taste it</p>
  <p time="313760" is_ac="false">Oh it's an American with an extra touch of banana a little milky I didn't expect it Eh I thought</p>
  <p time="325040" is_ac="false">it would become a very strange mixture a flavor I'm like vomiting and instead I have to tell you the truth it's</p>
  <p time="329800" is_ac="false">good Well you're spoiled for choice so let's start with the</p>
  <p time="333880" is_ac="false">bulgogi burger which is the Korean style grilled beef Bon</p>
  <p time="340400" is_ac="false">appetit mm I didn't expect a flavor like that for a packaged burger it looks like</p>
  <p time="349800" is_ac="false">a burger bought at fast food the bread is very soft a little sweet even the</p>
  <p time="354080" is_ac="false">sauce is a little sweet it's the beef burger it's really beef it looks like a sandwich</p>
  <p time="358840" is_ac="false">complete at the fast food here there is the onion the gherkins Wow Oh seriously this</p>
  <p time="364760" is_ac="false">hamburger is not a joke but now let's move on to the</p>
  <p time="371080" is_ac="false">pause guys notice some difference here I think they are two different things let's try how the</p>
  <p time="383720" is_ac="false">taste is a little sweet You can taste very little of the meat I don't know if it has been chopped very</p>
  <p time="391800" is_ac="false">very finely it's a vegan hamburger it's a little sweet a little spicy and you can taste the</p>
  <p time="396240" is_ac="false">spring onion a lot and I think it's ABB also a mustard fillet but the pa Leave it to the Chinese Oh it's</p>
  <p time="403560" is_ac="false">the time has come for copper it's a serious thing this is instant ramen and in</p>
  <p time="407880" is_ac="false">South Korean breakfast this can never be missing Eh but not just breakfast because breakfast here is not an</p>
  <p time="412800" is_ac="false">important meal I mean they don't really have a traditional breakfast for them Now for them</p>
  <p time="417280" is_ac="false">having breakfast is like a normal meal like a lunch or dinner and therefore they can eat all</p>
  <p time="422440" is_ac="false">this it's definitely very delicious because the sales assistant prepared it for us mm wow it's delicious</p>
  <p time="432400" is_ac="false">it's the first time I've eaten instant ramen in a com story in Korea I it's like being</p>
  <p time="436160" is_ac="false">inside a Korean Drama and for breakfast I chose this instant RAM with</p>
  <p time="442000" is_ac="false">sesame oil flavor so you can smell the sesame very much and I didn't get a super spicy one I got</p>
  <p time="446720" is_ac="false">a medium spicy one and it's 8 touches and it's a Marco that Koreans really like Let's move on to the</p>
  <p time="452520" is_ac="false">kimp Wow I thought I'd find something like that And bite it slowly but instead the kimps here have</p>
  <p time="464280" is_ac="false">already been cut ready to eat and we got the saut√©ed spicy pork</p>
  <p time="470480" is_ac="false">but it's not too bad you can taste the turnip, the pork then the flavor is on the sweet inside they</p>
  <p time="476240" is_ac="false">also put the perilla leaf come on I could have avoided it but the same thing for the coriander</p>
  <p time="480760" is_ac="false">in China I mean in China they put the coriander everywhere and in South Korea they put the FR</p>
  <p time="485440" is_ac="false">perilla everywhere that is they have to understand that not everyone likes everything eh And to alleviate</p>
  <p time="490440" is_ac="false">that flavor of the F of perilla Oh yes guys This is Korean culture they mix everything with</p>
  <p time="497520" is_ac="false">everything but they are really delicious they are heated up and</p>
  <p time="505080" is_ac="false">then there is the rice which absorbs all the broth which is very spicy and very</p>
  <p time="510360" is_ac="false">tasty and to conclude something which in my opinion is a little more normal for a</p>
  <p time="520160" is_ac="false">breakfast bread with red azuki beans Wow all the black sesame has fallen out Wait until</p>
  <p time="530800" is_ac="false">I collect everything otherwise the sales assistant here is killing me and inside it is full of</p>
  <p time="534920" is_ac="false">red bean jam from Zucchi nice sweet but not the sweet that hurts your teeth</p>
  <p time="541440" is_ac="false">red beans with courgette I use quite a bit here the bread is very soft thin rhinestones and it</p>
  <p time="546040" is_ac="false">contrasts with this black sesame which, as soon as you bite it, gives off a nice crunchy sesame scent</p>
  <p time="550720" is_ac="false">. As you may have noticed here in Asia they use the red azuki bean a lot to</p>
  <p time="558400" is_ac="false">make desserts so guys. Be careful not to confuse it with chocolate because here the</p>
  <p time="563400" is_ac="false">chocolate filling is really minimal. Most of the time you will find the red zui bean</p>
  <p time="575520" is_ac="false">and for lunch I'll take you to the 7-eleven which you all know by now but here</p>
  <p time="580440" is_ac="false">in South Korea you see less of it unlike gs25 and they are truly</p>
  <p time="585640" is_ac="false">everywhere Look here they have sweet potatoes</p>
  <p time="606560" is_ac="false">and here too it's full of stuff eh Even if we went to Rua everything and for lunch what do we eat</p>
  <p time="613320" is_ac="false">Truly we are spoiled for choice Look here what there is instant ramen and topok that is it's a</p>
  <p time="620280" is_ac="false">mixture and as a pairing you slap on a bit of Cheese Come on let's take two more here like that F</p>
  <p time="629440" is_ac="false">even more A nice shipment of I don't know what but it inspires me a lot then in the meantime let's take this one</p>
  <p time="633760" is_ac="false">here which Otherwise it's selling like hotcakes and it's no longer there I think it's not enough for me so let's take this too, a kind</p>
  <p time="639880" is_ac="false">of bento that also has chopsticks incorporated here we also find some eggs Because on top of the ramel</p>
  <p time="646200" is_ac="false">we always fit an egg I don't know if it's hard-boiled what does this one fit in marinated turnips And look at the</p>
  <p time="654920" is_ac="false">strange flavors of Oreo they have here in South Korea with a mint flavor and flavor and also for lunch you can</p>
  <p time="662160" is_ac="false">slap an American Bell on it but this time we'll do it another way Come on let's take this one here with</p>
  <p time="667080" is_ac="false">mandarin juice by jeju Nice black coffee even a glass of ice goes a</p>
  <p time="673560" is_ac="false">long way Here is our lunch in total we spent 25,500 oneon which is around ‚Ç¨17 and the</p>
  <p time="688520" is_ac="false">order was very very honest In the sense that here there were also active offers this one</p>
  <p time="693480" is_ac="false">it was like buy one and give you one so you get two instead of one even stick of mozzarella</p>
  <p time="699200" is_ac="false">we took two and he gave us one they are really honest eh all the Koreans are</p>
  <p time="703880" is_ac="false">very very honest maybe a little cold but they are honest and to start with we have our drink</p>
  <p time="720120" is_ac="false">what a drink came out beautiful very beautiful and like in the cafeteria in</p>
  <p time="725080" is_ac="false">China they already make mixed American coffee orange juice this one here is something</p>
  <p time="729440" is_ac="false">similar I mean Oh to the jeju mandarin juice only this one made by</p>
  <p time="734040" is_ac="false">us costs a lot much much less than what they sell in cafes in</p>
  <p time="738120" is_ac="false">China guys I could be a bartender I mean no look dachshund No evening never seen a dachshund</p>
  <p time="753120" is_ac="false">in my life in Asia it's the first nothing now let's start preparing our meal Mamo</p>
  <p time="758280" is_ac="false">this one which is already almost all prepared just put it in the microwave for a minute and a half and it's</p>
  <p time="763400" is_ac="false">ready and both in Thailand and in Japan and in China we ate this sort of bento</p>
  <p time="768840" is_ac="false">this set with rice Now let's see what this one tastes like here in Korea I unwrapped the</p>
  <p time="774240" is_ac="false">plastic outside and this stench of this food comes out it seems like someone has Schiato close by</p>
  <p time="780640" is_ac="false">it's normal because here in South Korea they eat a lot of garlic No Onion like even kimci already</p>
  <p time="785800" is_ac="false">of its own and hand a very very strong smell if you don't eat it we go to heat it up and here we have</p>
  <p time="791440" is_ac="false">everything at our disposal the boiling water the microwave oven the bins all near our</p>
  <p time="797040" is_ac="false">table and have you noticed that in every conven Store that we have been there they have places</p>
  <p time="814080" is_ac="false">Wow ready and here we find some white rice combined with an egg with some ravioli a saut√©ed meat</p>
  <p time="821640" is_ac="false">with kimchi the kimchi the courgettes and a bit of vegetables here we also added a</p>
  <p time="828480" is_ac="false">bit of pickled turnip m sweet a little sour very crunchy it opens up your appetite so Bon appetit</p>
  <p time="843360" is_ac="false">M this meat is cooked with kimchi which is really so tender so tasty let's try this</p>
  <p time="849240" is_ac="false">ravioli and this ravioli has been kind of fried inside There is some spring onion meat</p>
  <p time="858360" is_ac="false">but it's strange to see two first courses put together here we have kimci it doesn't make sense So it makes</p>
  <p time="866160" is_ac="false">sense but the courgettes too I think eh C taste and this too I think it's just for</p>
  <p time="872160" is_ac="false">beauty In my opinion it's up to scarf to do it all here even the Raviola dai scarfi amelo m Now</p>
  <p time="880880" is_ac="false">it makes much much more sense there's this red sauce which is very tasty a little spicy a little sweet</p>
  <p time="886920" is_ac="false">that with its creaminess you can eat tons of white rice every town has its</p>
  <p time="891640" is_ac="false">own flavor and here in Cora del Sud prevail The flavor of the kimsi Then the time has come</p>
  <p time="896080" is_ac="false">to prepare this here mixed boki Instant Ramini let's put the gnocchi be careful eh</p>
  <p time="906640" is_ac="false">This one can't be eaten here it's the anti-humidity it says do not eat so be careful eh</p>
  <p time="914600" is_ac="false">instant ramen you also have to recycle In fact here INCAs of the south are</p>
  <p time="922760" is_ac="false">very keen on recycling This is plastic all in the plastic boiling water</p>
  <p time="930120" is_ac="false">let's have microwaves and 30 seconds</p>
  <p time="934040" is_ac="false">come on let's go and throw away some</p>
  <p time="940360" is_ac="false">boiling water well Now we're in chef mode Nicola Jang at the</p>
  <p time="946520" is_ac="false">convenient Store I forgot to buy something wait I'll be</p>
  <p time="950040" is_ac="false">right there good I spent another 10000 Won which not even ‚Ç¨1 Oh not even ‚Ç¨1 the</p>
  <p time="964000" is_ac="false">nigiri costs here in South Korea it's not even 70 or tuna nigiri and here If you have</p>
  <p time="972520" is_ac="false">dirty hands don't worry because it's possible to remove the whole sachet without</p>
  <p time="976680" is_ac="false">touching it You've seen and we'll put this inside here the next step is</p>
  <p time="991880" is_ac="false">to break the whole nighiri we have the rice gnocchi the instant RAM and the rice mixed with a</p>
  <p time="998720" is_ac="false">bit of seaweed and the tuna and after putting the nighiri on top you also put other stuff on top</p>
  <p time="1004280" is_ac="false">mozzarella How nice We took two and gave another one as a gift so we had a</p>
  <p time="1013560" is_ac="false">beautiful, wonderful, stringy dish Wow then look at the cover Wolves Let's go as it is on its own mm it tastes</p>
  <p time="1027960" is_ac="false">like mozzarella and here we mustn't forget the sauce the soul of this dish no And the</p>
  <p time="1034040" is_ac="false">final touch let's go and put it to heat again it seems to be at my house</p>
  <p time="1044440" is_ac="false">Ah we already have the Spedini too Come on let's heat one up and heat it up</p>
  <p time="1049400" is_ac="false">40 seconds before heating we have to open it a little I learned this in</p>
  <p time="1054160" is_ac="false">Thailand here with all the radiation I become Superman eh oh No okay Look at what stuff has come</p>
  <p time="1063760" is_ac="false">outside Look at how many Crimi we're joking too The egg I still haven't figured out if it's a raw egg</p>
  <p time="1069680" is_ac="false">boiled egg egg I don't know it's a raw egg I didn't expect it like in Japan in Thailand even in China</p>
  <p time="1079120" is_ac="false">you can find this egg which is half cooked this one is raw Oh well let's break it in the meantime and</p>
  <p time="1085920" is_ac="false">put it back in the microwave it's like the hundredth time I've reheated something here Ok</p>
  <p time="1092920" is_ac="false">now it's ready come on it's the extra touch of the egg there was a bang eh And certainly of an</p>
  <p time="1098680" is_ac="false">absurd goodness because all the ingredients that we have slapped inside it are good and the</p>
  <p time="1102800" is_ac="false">Cig is missing on the cake the skewer this stuff is absurd Oh a Combo of carbohydrates let's go and taste</p>
  <p time="1110920" is_ac="false">it if you come to Korea and want to be a chef it's possible because</p>
  <p time="1122200" is_ac="false">in the Comen Store they have a lot of ingredients and you can invent all</p>
  <p time="1126880" is_ac="false">the possible combinations this one we have created Now it's all</p>
  <p time="1130640" is_ac="false">hell for us Then there's this skewer which is a sausage skewer it's spicy and sweet nice chewy nice</p>

  <p time="1170880" is_ac="false">then Wow inside it's like a mousse It's very</p>
  <p time="1181440" is_ac="false">light inside as you can see there's a chocolate mousse and a</p>
  <p time="1190600" is_ac="false">chocolate cream That is it's all the chocolate flavor but two different consistencies one is mousse and one is</p>
  <p time="1195200" is_ac="false">cream it is sweet just the right amount there is a hint of bitterness from the chocolate and the bread which is nice soft m you</p>
  <p time="1204640" is_ac="false">came to Korea this is I mean highly recommended very good Then if you find it in other flavors</p>

  <p time="1516560" is_ac="false">let's move on to these here because the writing hot Spice inspired me Let's see how hot they are</p>
  <p time="1522360" is_ac="false">Spicy I saved them for last because surely this one here has a slightly stronger flavor</p>
  <p time="1530880" is_ac="false">they are nice crispy square chips the flavor is very similar to Doritos only</p>
  <p time="1536600" is_ac="false">that it is sweeter and thinner and they are not spicy at all Lot Spicy is a farce I ate</p>
  <p time="1543600" is_ac="false">40,000 of them but still nothing not even that pinch of pepper nothing however they are good recommended even</p>
  <p time="1550120" is_ac="false">for those who don't eat spicy because they are not spicy at all it's time</p>
  <p time="1553680" is_ac="false">to eat this this squid m What a smell a smell of dried squid</p>

  <p time="1571160" is_ac="false">black it's hard but the taste isn't bad it tastes very fishy sicato is a little sweet at the first bite it's</p>
  <p time="1585080" is_ac="false">hard and after a while it slowly becomes tastier this one as an aperitif There's a bang</p>
  <p time="1590320" is_ac="false">that is a nice glass of soju that I can't we have it but we can't drink because As you will have</p>
  <p time="1595000" is_ac="false">understood the Conven Store in South Korea you can't drink alcohol unlike at dinner they</p>
  <p time="1600600" is_ac="false">have a little corner for making cocktails and you can drink it directly sitting there you see that</p>
  <p time="1607240" is_ac="false">the Comen Stores throughout Asia Yes they are always those chains but the rules change from country</p>
  <p time="1613240" is_ac="false">to country, for example in Thailand from certain hours to certain hours you cannot buy alcohol in China 24 hours a day you can</p>
  <p time="1620520" is_ac="false">and can even drink inside in South Korea however you can buy alcohol 24 hours a day</p>
  <p time="1625520" is_ac="false">But you cannot drink inside the shop in Japan they don't have any seats at all i.e.</p>
  <p time="1630560" is_ac="false">you rarely find seats inside and if there are they have a specific timetable i.e. they close</p>
  <p time="1635320" is_ac="false">at 7:00 in the evening like they don't I know if you remember the episode we did in Japan on the Conven</p>
  <p time="1639680" is_ac="false">Store we always ate outside sitting on the park benches So yes throughout Asia</p>

  <p time="1793520" is_ac="false">and the sauce is nice and creamy, it tastes like a lot of curry and is very cheesy and very</p>
  <p time="1798160" is_ac="false">spicy and it's sweet In fact I realized that in South Korea a lot of dishes are</p>
  <p time="1802440" is_ac="false">sweet and spicy then sometimes Oh well try some sour kimchi too But if there's no</p>
  <p time="1806920" is_ac="false">kimchi the flavor is predominantly sweet and spicy good eh A sweet curry the</p>

  <p time="1851880" is_ac="false">the meat it's the first time I've eaten it in the rice version and it goes really</p>
  <p time="1855720" is_ac="false">well It's time for the chicken feet you didn't expect them to be those are</p>
  <p time="1861240" is_ac="false">chicken feet boned dis okay without bones and therefore you can eat them straight away mm</p>
  <p time="1871720" is_ac="false">the meat is really tender sometimes it manages to bite into the cartilage There is the sauce which</p>
  <p time="1876360" is_ac="false">is sweet and very spicy and the cochu there is the chilli sauce the Korean one which they use very</p>
  <p time="1881480" is_ac="false">often in their cooking and I really like it I mean Wow I finished the peach tea now let's move</p>

  <p time="1920120" is_ac="false">mm it's like black sesame flavored cream and then underneath there's also a layer made with</p>
  <p time="1925640" is_ac="false">glutinous rice flour the consistency is like Mochi soft chewy it's nice light</p>

  <p time="1936120" is_ac="false">it's really delicious let's move on to these other balls of I don't know what they look like</p>
  <p time="1942360" is_ac="false">they were rolled by hand And we have three different colors Oh and it seems</p>
  <p time="1948160" is_ac="false">to be made with natural ingredients because the smell is really natural natural</p>
  <p time="1951280" is_ac="false">eh mm the outside layer is nice floury sweet I think it was</p>

  <p time="1969560" is_ac="false">color this one the consistency is the same identical on the outside there is this Macia flavored batter</p>

  <p time="1994120" is_ac="false">azuki red bean jam then Inside there is the nice soft Mochi and inside there is still a bit</p>
  <p time="1998680" is_ac="false">of azuki red bean jam But have you eaten some Mochi or tangyan of this</p>
