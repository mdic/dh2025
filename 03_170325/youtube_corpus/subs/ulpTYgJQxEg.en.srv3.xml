  <p time="87501" is_ac="false">Talking about Antoni Gaudi, let’s continue to 
his most famous masterpiece - La Sagrada Familia,  </p>
  <p time="93600" is_ac="false">a large Roman Catholic church, considered one of 
the greatest works of architecture in the world.</p>
  <p time="100528" is_ac="false">Construction of the church began in 1882 and

and intricate carvings. It is one of Spain's  </p>
  <p time="120060" is_ac="false">most visited tourist attractions and a UNESCO 
World Heritage Site. Francisco De Paula del Villar  </p>
  <p time="125880" is_ac="false">was initially the chief architect of the 
Sagrada Família. However, he resigned after a year  </p>
  <p time="130680" is_ac="false">and was replaced by Gaudi, who incorporated Gothic
and Art Nouveau styles into the church's design. </p>

  <p time="193800" is_ac="false">notorious for its scammers and thieves, so 
much so, that Barcelona has been nicknamed  </p>
  <p time="199020" is_ac="false">the pickpocket capital of the world. Always
