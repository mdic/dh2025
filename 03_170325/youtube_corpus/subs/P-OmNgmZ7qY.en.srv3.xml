  <p time="80" is_ac="false">Hey friends hope you're well the iPhone 16 is more 
similar to the 16 Pro as it ever has been and from  </p>
  <p time="6760" is_ac="false">$799 I actually think it represents pretty good 
value after I reviewed the 16 Pro I switched over  </p>
  <p time="13800" is_ac="false">to the iPhone 16 and I've been using it for the 
last few weeks since and so in this video I'll  </p>
  <p time="19720" is_ac="false">compare my iPhone 16 experience to not just the 
16 Pro but also with the iPhone 14 and the iPhone  </p>
  <p time="27120" is_ac="false">13 I think this phone could be that sweet upgrade 
from an older generation iPhone or a great entry  </p>
  <p time="33920" is_ac="false">point for Android users wanting to switch to an 
iPhone so let's start with the design visually  </p>
  <p time="40080" is_ac="false">it's not a huge change but there are a few changes 
firstly this teal color is super nice it's the  </p>
  <p time="46760" is_ac="false">first time I'm really hesitant to cover it up 
with a case the teal is really vibrant under all  </p>
  <p time="53040" is_ac="false">sorts of lighting and has a nice frosted finish 
and yet manages to still look really premium I  </p>
  <p time="60040" is_ac="false">really like it a lot actually and wish Apple 
offered more vibrant colors like this on the pro  </p>
  <p time="64800" is_ac="false">lineup the other visual change is the vertical 
stacking of cameras similar to the previous  </p>
  <p time="70560" is_ac="false">design of the iPhone 12 I believe the reason 
Apple reverted back to this design is because  </p>
  <p time="76240" is_ac="false">when it's held horizontally the side by-side 
cameras better support spatial video instead  </p>
  <p time="81560" is_ac="false">of the diagonal position that we're used to in 
the previous iPhones which would make processing  </p>
  <p time="86920" is_ac="false">spatial video much more tricky the iPhone 16 also 
gets both the new buttons from the pro the action  </p>
  <p time="93800" is_ac="false">button and the capture button which if you've 
seen my 16 Pro review you know that I think  </p>
  <p time="98880" is_ac="false">both buttons are a bit of a gimmick and after 
using it for a longer period on the uh iPhone  </p>
  <p time="104680" is_ac="false">16 yeah I'm still not a fan unfortunately in fact 
since the 16 Pro I've noticed that I'm constantly  </p>
  <p time="112440" is_ac="false">uh pressing the capture button by accidents 
just because it's placed in an area that is  </p>
  <p time="116880" is_ac="false">always accidentally pressed uh but I'm holding 
on to see how Apple Intelligence makes use of  </p>
  <p time="122440" is_ac="false">this button before I make any final conclusions 
on this capture button there are also a few less  </p>
  <p time="128640" is_ac="false">obvious design changes worth pointing out the 
display has what Apple calls the Next Generation  </p>
  <p time="134400" is_ac="false">Ceramic Shield that's 50% tougher and so I went 
this month without using a case on the iPhone 16  </p>
  <p time="141920" is_ac="false">at all and the good news is no problems or scuffs 
just yet it's held up perfectly fine uh with daily  </p>
  <p time="148840" is_ac="false">use and I think that's great cuz like I said this 
phone looks lovely okay future me just jumping in  </p>
  <p time="154240" is_ac="false">real quick as I'm editing this video it's been 
a few days since I said that statement about  </p>
  <p time="159280" is_ac="false">the screen but since then I've checked the screen 
and there's actually been a few scuffs and marks  </p>
  <p time="165400" is_ac="false">on the screen so unfortunately I highly recommend 
a screen protector you might be able to get away  </p>
  <p time="171520" is_ac="false">without a case but the screen isn't as durable 
as I initially thought so yeah I just wanted to  </p>
  <p time="177360" is_ac="false">jump in and say that with its weight I did notice 
the weight difference right away switching over  </p>
  <p time="183200" is_ac="false">from the 16 Pro it's a full ounce lighter now than 
the 16 Pro but only 1 G lighter than the previous  </p>
  <p time="190240" is_ac="false">iPhone 15 overall the design of the iPhone 16 
feels really nice in hand especially without  </p>
  <p time="197640" is_ac="false">a case the internal layout has been reconfigured 
to accommodate a larger battery and also improves  </p>
  <p time="203400" is_ac="false">heat dissipation which I'll talk about in a moment 
um because yeah the heating issue is unfortunately  </p>
  <p time="209400" is_ac="false">still here and it still gets stupidly warm in 
hand the iPhone 16 surprisingly gets the new  </p>
  <p time="216360" is_ac="false">audio mix feature which I thought was going to 
be a pro only thing it's so op to edit a video  </p>
  <p time="222720" is_ac="false">Sound Stage and separate audio to background and 
foreground tracks to really take advantage and  </p>
  <p time="228800" is_ac="false">hear this though you want a good pair of earphones 
and that's where sound's new c4i clipon earbuds  </p>
  <p time="235320" is_ac="false">come in and for transparency they're sponsoring 
the segment of the video so these earbuds have a  </p>
  <p time="240760" is_ac="false">really unique clip-on design that not only looks 
dope on your ears but practically they're both  </p>
  <p time="245800" is_ac="false">more comfortable and have a more secure fit than 
traditional earbuds or headphones The Cutting Edge  </p>
  <p time="251920" is_ac="false">ear grips are designed for complete movement so 
I can work out at the gym or go for a run warry  </p>
  <p time="257440" is_ac="false">free especially with its ipx for water resistance 
and the Easy Button controls in the back for quick  </p>
  <p time="262560" is_ac="false">music controls the flexible joints make this a 
suitable and comfortable fit for all ear types  </p>
  <p time="267360" is_ac="false">as well the open ear design doesn't sacrifice on 
audio quality either the racetrack Dynamic drivers  </p>
  <p time="273120" is_ac="false">with titanium coded design deliver pretty clear 
audio and the c4i is also Bluetooth 5.4 compatible  </p>
  <p time="279960" is_ac="false">allowing devices to pair directly to the earbuds 
the charging case itself offers up to 21 hours  </p>
  <p time="285760" is_ac="false">of playback and yeah overall these clip on earbuds 
represent pretty good value particularly if you're  </p>
  <p time="292120" is_ac="false">looking for earbuds on the move you can learn more 
about the soundcore c40i and check out the launch  </p>
  <p time="298800" is_ac="false">offer through the the link in the description box 
below now when it comes to the cameras and photos  </p>
  <p time="304240" is_ac="false">they're more similar to the iPhone 16 Pro than I 
thought it would be especially in good lighting  </p>
  <p time="310240" is_ac="false">conditions like outside on a sunny day so this 
phone does miss out on the 5x telephoto camera and  </p>
  <p time="316800" is_ac="false">the new 42MP Ultra wide that the pro version gets 
but unless you like heavily shoot Ultra wide and  </p>
  <p time="324040" is_ac="false">5x Zoom photos the iPhone 16 doesn't really miss 
out on all that much especially with the right  </p>
  <p time="330840" is_ac="false">camera settings switched on I tested both the 16 
and the 16 Pro together over the month and the  </p>
  <p time="337240" is_ac="false">iPhone 16 does a seriously good job for a $799 
phone there's not a huge difference in quality  </p>
  <p time="343720" is_ac="false">between the two phones until you use of course the 
ultrawide zoom functions or you shoot in Pro roll  </p>
  <p time="350120" is_ac="false">mode but in low light you can also tell that the 
pro is able to lift out more detail in the darker  </p>
  <p time="356360" is_ac="false">areas of the photos and just generally looks 
better I think think but if you're just taking  </p>
  <p time="361400" is_ac="false">photos to throw up on social media or to keep as 
memories honestly the iPhone 16 can do basically  </p>
  <p time="367680" is_ac="false">everything you want it to do and there's no need 
to shoot Pro raw anyway so you're not missing out  </p>
  <p time="373240" is_ac="false">on that feature and of course the new photographic 
Styles feature is as fun as ever just like it is  </p>
  <p time="378800" is_ac="false">on the 16 Pro it lets you quickly color grade your 
photos Live While You're composing the shot or you  </p>
  <p time="385000" is_ac="false">can even edit it and edit the color grade on the 
photo in post I think it's a particularly good  </p>
  <p time="391160" is_ac="false">feature on the iPhone 16 because we can't shoot 
Raw photos on the base iPhones which means we  </p>
  <p time="397600" is_ac="false">don't get the extra data in the photos to edit 
and post on apps like Lightroom so it's really  </p>
  <p time="404040" is_ac="false">nice actually that you can quickly apply a custom 
filter and look in the camera app itself and it's  </p>
  <p time="410280" is_ac="false">more than enough for the average mobile user as 
with video it's great but it doesn't get that  </p>
  <p time="416000" is_ac="false">beautiful Dolby 4K 120 video recording available 
on the Pro Models and that's absolutely a feature  </p>
  <p time="422560" is_ac="false">that sets the pro apart that you'll probably 
want to consider if you're big on video that  </p>
  <p time="426720" is_ac="false">doesn't mean the video isn't any good it's still 
one of the leaders in mobile video and looks  </p>
  <p time="432320" is_ac="false">awesome as you can see here but it just doesn't 
look as good as Doby Vision 4K 120 next the a18  </p>
  <p time="439640" is_ac="false">performance has been Stellar I think these chips 
have become so good that the difference between  </p>
  <p time="445280" is_ac="false">the base chip and the pro variant is just so 
minimal for like 90% of phone users between  </p>
  <p time="452120" is_ac="false">the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 in daily use 
I really didn't feel much of a difference it's  </p>
  <p time="458680" is_ac="false">only when gaming shooting 4K videos or applying 
the new photographic Styles will you ever feel  </p>
  <p time="464880" is_ac="false">a slight difference in responsiveness based on 
geekbench 6 the iPhone 16's performance in single  </p>
  <p time="471000" is_ac="false">and multi-core tests is comparable to a M1 iPad 
and even faster than an iPhone 15 Pro which is  </p>
  <p time="479720" is_ac="false">pretty wild it also represents a huge 30% 
performance leap from the iPhone 13 and 14  </p>
  <p time="486720" is_ac="false">which both use an a15 bionic chip so if you're 
upgrading from these phones the iPhone 1314  </p>
  <p time="493360" is_ac="false">you're going to really feel the difference in 
daily use apple has also bumped up Ram from 6  </p>
  <p time="499360" is_ac="false">to 8 GB so multitasking and app performance over 
the month has been honestly just as smooth as the  </p>
  <p time="506640" is_ac="false">iPhone 16 Pro it's really that good I feel like 
apple has almost had to like purposely Nerf the  </p>
  <p time="512800" is_ac="false">iPhone 16 and not give it certain features just 
so there's incentive still to get the pro model  </p>
  <p time="519080" is_ac="false">I think it's really awesome though that we've 
you know got to a stage of mobile computing  </p>
  <p time="523360" is_ac="false">power where almost everyone benefits from the 
performance increases whether or not a phone  </p>
  <p time="529600" is_ac="false">has the more expensive pro tag on it battery life 
over the month has also been a selling point I'm  </p>
  <p time="535760" is_ac="false">getting anywhere between 8 to 12 hours of mixed 
use each day and that's at least an hour or two  </p>
  <p time="541880" is_ac="false">more than the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro it's great 
to see the efficiency of the A8 chip pump out a  </p>
  <p time="549120" is_ac="false">roughly 15% boost in battery life from the iPhone 
15 and a big 20 to 25% jump from the iPhone 14 and  </p>
  <p time="557560" is_ac="false">13 Even though this is an improvement it still 
does lag behind the pixel 9 which has a bigger  </p>
  <p time="563480" is_ac="false">4575 mamp battery and I got 10 to 14 hours of 
mixed usage on on that phone when I tested it  </p>
  <p time="570800" is_ac="false">a few months ago all right so the first few weeks 
uh the thought passed my mind do I you know really  </p>
  <p time="576320" is_ac="false">need the iPhone 16 Pro because the iPhone 16 is 
so far more than great but here's where I think  </p>
  <p time="583520" is_ac="false">this phone falls short and the negatives that I've 
experienced over the month the first one has to  </p>
  <p time="589360" is_ac="false">be its dated 60 HZ display it's not exactly a bad 
display it's just that once you start using 120 HZ  </p>
  <p time="596600" is_ac="false">display having that refresh rate feels like pretty 
sluggish experience scrolling settings websites  </p>
  <p time="603680" is_ac="false">and social media just isn't as fluid and when we 
consider that the similarly priced Bas pixel 9  </p>
  <p time="610160" is_ac="false">has a beautiful 120hz OLED display or even other 
Android uh phones entrylevel Android phones have  </p>
  <p time="617440" is_ac="false">120 HZ displays it's a shame that the iPhone 16 
still has a 60 HZ display the other negative is  </p>
  <p time="624680" is_ac="false">its price for an iPhone sure it's nicely priced 
and it Stacks up pretty well when compared to the  </p>
  <p time="631240" is_ac="false">iPhone 16 Pro but when we look at similar Android 
phones that's when you realize you could get a lot  </p>
  <p time="638120" is_ac="false">more bang for buck for example the similar price 
Galaxy s24 or Google pixel9 gets far higher Peak  </p>
  <p time="645280" is_ac="false">brightness much more RAM bigger batteries and far 
faster charging speeds as you can see here in this  </p>
  <p time="651760" is_ac="false">comparison chart the other two sticking points 
are unfortunately similar to the iPhone 16 Pro  </p>
  <p time="658160" is_ac="false">number one there's no sign of Apple intelligence 
at launch and the iPhone 16 yes also gets very hot  </p>
  <p time="666040" is_ac="false">in hand under intensive use or in hot environments 
actually heck even when I was charging it at my  </p>
  <p time="673560" is_ac="false">desk in cool room temperatures it gets oddly 
warm and so it seems like apple still has some  </p>
  <p time="680360" is_ac="false">tinkering to do to get the iPhone temperatures 
to a much better place so the iPhone 16 is far  </p>
  <p time="686800" is_ac="false">from perfect but after 1 month of here's why I 
still think it hits the sweet spot as an iPhone  </p>
  <p time="693720" is_ac="false">for like 80% of people so there's less and less 
between the pro and the base iPhone 16 and this  </p>
  <p time="701720" is_ac="false">phone is a significant improvement over several 
generation old models think the iPhone 12 11 X  </p>
  <p time="710440" is_ac="false">or even older so if you're planning on upgrading 
from an older iPhone and you want to pocket a few  </p>
  <p time="716800" is_ac="false">hundred and you know you don't need a better 
Ultra wide camera video and battery life the  </p>
  <p time="722800" is_ac="false">iPhone 16 isn't Awesome by representing that 
very sweet spot in value but if we compare it  </p>
  <p time="730080" is_ac="false">to the iPhone 15 or 14 yeah look there's not 
much here that begs for your hard-earned cash  </p>
  <p time="736360" is_ac="false">you're probably just better off swapping in a new 
battery and that phone should last you another  </p>
  <p time="741440" is_ac="false">few years in fact there's rumors that apple 
is now considering moving away from releasing  </p>
  <p time="747120" is_ac="false">new iPhones every year so you know they have more 
time for new hardware to be developed I think this  </p>
  <p time="752880" is_ac="false">makes a lot of sense we don't need new hardware 
every single year and we sort of need to accept  </p>
  <p time="758640" is_ac="false">the days of massive leaps like the iPhone 3GS to 
the 4 or the 7 to the X those days are behind us  </p>
  <p time="767720" is_ac="false">we're not going to get way bigger screens crazy 
better cameras or much faster chips every year  </p>
  <p time="773040" is_ac="false">so yeah I'd say that this phone hits that sweet 
spot in the sub $1,000 budget range but the one  </p>
  <p time="780320" is_ac="false">thing that was supposed to set the iPhone 16 apart 
from other phones Apple intelligence Still Remains  </p>
  <p time="788200" is_ac="false">only a promise and as MZ famously says never buy 
a product based on the promise of future features</p>
