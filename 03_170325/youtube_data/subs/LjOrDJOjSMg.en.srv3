bathe in what to them is a sacred river,</p>

<p t="62373" d="2655">to meet the most extraordinary
people on the planet,</p>

<p t="68960" d="3111">Welcome to Progetto Happiness.</p>
<p t="74320" d="6580">This is how the day begins in
Varanasi, India&#39;s holy city.</p>
<p t="80920" d="5100">I am surrounded
by people, by noise.</p>
<p t="86040" d="3450">So much clamor and dust.</p>
<p t="89520" d="3580">It is unbelievable.
It&#39;s only 5 AM.</p>
<p t="94240" d="2690">The city is already bursting with life.</p>
<p t="96960" d="6040">I&#39;m going now to the Ganges River
to meet a real Aghori</p>
<p t="103000" d="4320">to find out what he believes
and how he lives</p>
<p t="107320" d="3780">as a follower of
the teachings of Shiva.</p>
<p t="111120" d="1540">Who are the Aghori?</p>
<p t="112680" d="3200">They are an extremist
movement of Hindu ascetics</p>
<p t="115880" d="2660">who worship Shiva,
the god of destruction.</p>
<p t="118560" d="3220">They eat everything a
human would never eat:</p>
<p t="121800" d="4260">garbage, feces, urine and
even human remains.</p>
<p t="126080" d="4320">They are convinced that these
inhumane practices destroy their ego</p>
<p t="130400" d="2700">and help them reach moksha faster,</p>
<p t="133120" d="3380">that is, liberation from the
cycle of reincarnation.</p>
<p t="136520" d="2960">On the side of the road
are dozens of women</p>
<p t="139480" d="4680">who sell these canisters of all sizes</p>
<p t="144160" d="3800">for believers going to
the banks of the Ganges</p>
<p t="147960" d="2880">to collect some water
to take back home</p>
<p t="150840" d="4800">for their loved ones who are
not well or cannot come here</p>
<p t="155640" d="3090">so they may drink from
the Ganges before dying.</p>
<p t="158760" d="2660">It is the most important
thing for them.</p>
<p t="161440" d="3760">We&#39;ll see many people
buying these canisters</p>
<p t="165200" d="2586">and then go and fill them
up from the Ganges.</p>
<p t="174080" d="2020">Behind me is a very interesting scene.</p>
<p t="176120" d="3660">There are two women who are
totally shaving their heads.</p>
<p t="179800" d="2660">It&#39;s a custom of the women
of southern India.</p>
<p t="182480" d="3190">Before plunging into the sacred river
to purify themselves,</p>
<p t="185671" d="2543">they shave their heads.</p>
<p t="193320" d="2800">Now we are going to take a boat</p>
<p t="196120" d="2380">to reach the other side
of the Ganges River.</p>
<p t="198520" d="2560">and meet probably one of

all drain here,</p>
<p t="252301" d="4359">and also tons of ash
from the daily cremations.</p>

need to immerse themselves</p>
<p t="259600" d="3660">at least once in the sacred
river and drink its water.</p>
<p t="263280" d="3980">They also wash their clothes and
brush their teeth in this water,</p>
<p t="267280" d="2620">Which, more than holy water,
is dead water.</p>
<p t="269920" d="3780">It is a desecrated sacred
river that kills people.</p>

<p t="285360" d="2780">If we ask the boatman
if he drinks it,</p>
<p t="288160" d="2820">I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll say yes.
Let&#39;s see.</p>
<p t="291000" d="2240">Do you drink this water?</p>
<p t="293240" d="3760">Sure!
It is good for you.</p>

practicing Shab Saadhna, a meditation.</p>
<p t="442157" d="5372">Shab Saadhna consists of
sitting on the dead bodies and meditating.</p>

How did you become an Aghori?</p>
<p t="466920" d="5600">First you must receive
consecration from a guru.</p>
<p t="472520" d="2940">After that you have to meditate
in the cremation place.</p>
<p t="475480" d="3620">You have to live, sleep and
eat there all the time.</p>
<p t="479120" d="3668">You have to do this
for a minimum of 12 years,</p>
<p t="482789" d="2711">after which you become an Aghori.</p>
<p t="485520" d="2900">At least 12 years of meditation.</p>
<p t="488440" d="4848">By continuing to meditate consistently,</p>
<p t="493488" d="4772">you will gain awareness of your powers.</p>
<p t="498280" d="4644">If a person decides to become an Aghori,</p>
<p t="503124" d="4096">he or she must leave home at age 10.</p>
<p t="507221" d="5250">Cremation sites become our
home where we eat and sleep.</p>

What is the ash on your body?</p>
<p t="518480" d="5923">We collect it at the end
of the cremation ceremony</p>
<p t="524404" d="3316">and sprinkle it on our body.</p>
<p t="527720" d="3009">All the Aghori do this.</p>
<p t="535120" d="2900">I think he went to pee.</p>
<p t="538040" d="3980">He got up and left
and is now squatting there.</p>
<p t="542040" d="3902">Can an Aghori have sex
with women or men?</p>
<p t="547443" d="2497">We do not marry,
we have no relationships.</p>
<p t="549960" d="3869">We keep company with men
and women,</p>
<p t="553830" d="2110">but nothing more than that.</p>
<p t="555960" d="2940">Why are people afraid
of the Aghori?</p>
<p t="558920" d="6380">The Aghori look dangerous but
inside we are like children.</p>
<p t="565320" d="3420">He is asking if
you are scared of him.</p>
<p t="568760" d="4160">No, because he is smiling.</p>
<p t="572920" d="2500">No, he is not scary to me.</p>
<p t="575440" d="2730">Last question, the most important one.</p>
<p t="578370" d="2530">He&#39;s over it, he is tired.</p>
<p t="580920" d="2360">What is happiness for an Aghori?</p>
<p t="583280" d="2064">Whether it is me or another Aghori,</p>
<p t="585544" d="2941">all we want is to make
other people happy.</p>
<p t="588486" d="2768">For example, you came here,</p>
<p t="591454" d="3286">if you go home happy,
I am happy.</p>
<p t="594760" d="5440">We find happiness in others&#39;
happiness, not our own.</p>
<p t="600960" d="5620">Let us abandon hatred and
violence to give love to all.</p>
<p t="606600" d="6000">You have to behave kindly to everyone.</p>
<p t="615840" d="3080">He just asked me if he could bless me</p>
<p t="618920" d="2800">with ashes on my head and...</p>
<p t="621720" d="2500">It sounds like a bad idea, as always.</p>

trying out the Insta360 X3,</p>

<p t="657360" d="2820">especially in situations like this,</p>
<p t="660200" d="2680">where you can&#39;t miss
a single moment.</p>
<p t="662880" d="3500">Plus, it has remarkable
technical features.</p>
<p t="666400" d="3840">The X3 has a new larger
48-megapixel sensor</p>
<p t="670240" d="4060">and allows me to make better
content even in low light.</p>
<p t="674320" d="2620">Plus I can do time lapse at 8K</p>
<p t="676960" d="4420">and amazing slow motion
at 120 fps in 4k.</p>
<p t="681400" d="2780">It is waterproof to a depth of ten meters,</p>
<p t="684200" d="2580">without need for a case
or other accessories.</p>
<p t="686800" d="3820">I can jump into the water
and film right away.</p>
<p t="690640" d="4340">Most useful when traveling is
the 2.29-inch touchscreen.</p>

even on the sunniest days.</p>
<p t="699360" d="1980">So even if the sun is
right above me,</p>

<p t="715640" d="2302">imagine how I felt
with him in front of me.</p>
<p t="717943" d="2397">I think we need to focus
on the reason why</p>
<p t="720360" d="2380">he performs these extreme acts.</p>
<p t="722760" d="5180">Deep down, he simply
wants to destroy his ego.</p>
<p t="727960" d="3160">He does these exercises
that are so inhuman</p>
<p t="731120" d="3100">because he wants to think
of God so intensely.</p>
<p t="734240" d="3760">Even when, for example,
he eats human flesh</p>
<p t="738000" d="2660">or eats his feces,
drinks his pee.</p>
<p t="740680" d="4540">It is an extreme exercise,
difficult to share,</p>

<p t="984943" d="1699">Wife dies,
it is the husband.</p>
<p t="986643" d="2111">After shaving he
bathes in the Ganges.</p>
<p t="988755" d="2444">He wears a white cloth
and goes to light a fire</p>
<p t="991200" d="1800">to begin the cremation.</p>
<p t="993043" d="2217">You can see the cremation here.</p>
<p t="995280" d="3940">Do you see that man?
He&#39;s going to start the burning.</p>
<p t="999243" d="1496">- He&#39;s the son?
- Yes.</p>
<p t="1000740" d="3760">These are the feet, and
on the other side is the head.</p>
<p t="1004520" d="4440">It takes between 2 and 3 hours
to burn the body.</p>
<p t="1008960" d="2820">This is the ground for cremations.</p>
<p t="1011800" d="3100">Every day 200-300 bodies are burned.</p>
<p t="1014920" d="3860">After that, the remains are
put into the river.</p>
<p t="1018800" d="2340">In Hinduism, some bodies are not burned:</p>
<p t="1021160" d="2331">Gurus, children, animals, lepers,</p>
<p t="1023691" d="2909">pregnant women,
and people bitten by cobras.</p>
<p t="1026600" d="1520">They don&#39;t get cremated.</p>
<p t="1028120" d="1780">Gurus are already pure,</p>
<p t="1029920" d="2650">Children under the age
of 12 are innocent.</p>
<p t="1032600" d="2140">Animals are the symbol of deities.</p>
<p t="1034760" d="2653">Pregnant women are
carrying an innocent life.</p>
<p t="1037414" d="2916">The cobra is the necklace of Shiva.</p>
<p t="1040360" d="1860">These bodies are tied
to a large rock,</p>
<p t="1042240" d="3080">taken by boat to the middle of
the Ganges and are left to sink</p>
<p t="1045320" d="2309">without burning them.</p>
<p t="1060440" d="2431">After so many years of creaming bodies,</p>
<p t="1062872" d="2278">what do you think about death?</p>
<p t="1065350" d="2490">People come here to die
to attain moksha,</p>
<p t="1067840" d="2800">because this place was
created by the god Shiva.</p>
<p t="1070640" d="3000">He is the god of destruction.</p>
<p t="1073640" d="3560">So people come here to destroy
the cycle of reincarnation.</p>
<p t="1077200" d="6180">If people have good karma they
will directly reach moksha.</p>
<p t="1083400" d="3100">It seems that no one
here is afraid of death.</p>
<p t="1086520" d="2250">They respect and celebrate it.</p>
<p t="1088800" d="3040">It&#39;s a celebration in Hinduism,
because it is part of life.</p>
<p t="1091840" d="2759">We all will die one day,
we are not here forever.</p>
<p t="1094600" d="2720">When people are alive
they&#39;re proud.</p>
<p t="1097320" d="2620">My houses, my money,
my this, my that.</p>
<p t="1099960" d="3050">But after death, it&#39;s  &quot;ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.&quot;</p>
<p t="1103040" d="2831">Nobody carries anything with them.</p>
<p t="1112160" d="1149">It&#39;s time to go.</p>
<p t="1113310" d="2218">Varanasi gives us one last gift.</p>
<p t="1115529" d="2651">The ƒÄrti ceremony is about to begin,</p>
<p t="1118200" d="2400">the celebration of the Ganges River,</p>
<p t="1120600" d="2490">which they call
the Mother Goddess Ganga.</p>
<p t="1123120" d="3130">The main element
of this ceremony is fire.</p>
<p t="1126280" d="2140">It will be an incredible show.</p>
<p t="1128440" d="3402">Fire symbolizes the light
that drives away darkness,</p>
<p t="1131843" d="2687">The darkness that comes
when a life ends.</p>
<p t="1134560" d="2769">It is very symbolic,
especially in places</p>
<p t="1137330" d="2398">where people come to die.</p>
<p t="1139729" d="4071">It also gives a sense of peace
knowing those cremated here</p>
<p t="1143800" d="3919">have died or been cremated
in the place they dreamed of.</p>
<p t="1147720" d="2220">No one knows what
happens after death,</p>
<p t="1149960" d="2282">but in the holy city,
everyone&#39;s convinced</p>
<p t="1152243" d="2377">that it&#39;s a new beginning to celebrate.</p>
<p t="1154640" d="3170">That sounds like a great
lesson for someone like me,</p>
<p t="1157840" d="2930">who grew up in a world
where death is taboo.</p>
<p t="1160800" d="2480">Instead we should
remember that deep down,</p>
<p t="1163280" d="3490">we are born to die and therefore
every day must be celebrated.</p>
<p t="1166800" d="2400">Perhaps in this adventure
the main lesson</p>
<p t="1169200" d="2400">I&#39;ll take home is &quot;memento mori,&quot;</p>
<p t="1171600" d="1913">to remember that
we&#39;re going to die.</p>
<p t="1173514" d="2526">Perhaps it is a great
gift to remind us</p>
<p t="1176040" d="3100">that we should devote our
lives to being happy,</p>
<p t="1179160" d="3610">because if not,
we haven&#39;t really lived.</p>
