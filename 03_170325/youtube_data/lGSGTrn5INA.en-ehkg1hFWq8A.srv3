<p t="1890" d="2130">are all over the internet these days,</p>
<p t="4020" d="3600">so I decided to put ChatGPT to the test</p>
<p t="7620" d="3210">and see how well it can answer
some serious medical trivia</p>
<p t="10830" d="1320">and ethical questions.</p>
<p t="12150" d="2760">Huge thanks to NordVPN
for sponsoring this video.</p>
<p t="14910" d="1560">Be whoop.</p>
<p t="16470" d="5000">What should I do if I find
someone who isn&#39;t breathing?</p>
<p t="22680" d="1410">You know what I&#39;m about to say.</p>
<p t="24090" d="2280">Call for help first, and
then chest compression,</p>
<p t="26370" d="1200">chest compression, chest compressions.</p>
<p t="27570" d="2940">But let&#39;s see what ChatGPT says, bam.</p>
<p t="30510" d="1800">It involves performing chest compressions</p>
<p t="32310" d="1170">and rescue breathing</p>
<p t="33480" d="1980">to circulate oxygen-rich
blood to the body.</p>
<p t="35460" d="833">It is important to note</p>
<p t="36293" d="2527">that performing CPR without
proper training or certification</p>
<p t="38820" d="1950">may cause harm to the person
you&#39;re trying to help.</p>
<p t="40770" d="1620">Well, how about this, ChatGPTT?</p>
<p t="42390" d="2190">I&#39;m gonna give you like an
eight out 10 on this one.</p>
<p t="44580" d="930">This is really good.</p>
<p t="45510" d="2250">If you are innocent bystander,</p>
<p t="47760" d="2100">you should not try doing rescue breaths,</p>
<p t="49860" d="2940">and you should just try
and perform hands-only CPR.</p>
<p t="52800" d="2160">Unless you&#39;re trained and
you know how to do it,</p>
<p t="54960" d="870">you&#39;re gonna get confused</p>
<p t="55830" d="1380">when you&#39;re trying to do rescue breaths.</p>
<p t="57210" d="2580">So just do hands-only CPR</p>
<p t="59790" d="2298">to the tune of the famous
song &quot;Staying Alive&quot;.</p>
<p t="62088" d="1992">♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪</p>
<p t="64080" d="4410">Is tap water safe to drink?</p>
<p t="68490" d="2670">In general, tap water is
considered safe to drink</p>
<p t="71160" d="2010">in the United States and
many other countries.</p>
<p t="73170" d="2040">The water supplied by
municipal authorities</p>
<p t="75210" d="1530">is regularly tested and treated</p>
<p t="76740" d="2550">to ensure that it meets safety standards</p>
<p t="79290" d="1260">for various contaminants,</p>
<p t="80550" d="1920">such as bacteria, viruses, and chemicals.</p>
<p t="82470" d="1470">Water quality can vary depending</p>
<p t="83940" d="2160">on the location and
infrastructure of a specific area,</p>
<p t="86100" d="900">so it&#39;s always good to check</p>
<p t="87000" d="2250">with your local water
authority or utility company</p>
<p t="89250" d="1710">to get info about the specific quality</p>
<p t="90960" d="1230">of the tap water in your area.</p>
<p t="92190" d="1200">You can opt for filtered water,</p>
<p t="93390" d="1350">bottled water, alternative source.</p>
<p t="94740" d="2160">Okay, that this is a
this is a nine outta 10,</p>
<p t="96900" d="1110">10 outta 10 answer.</p>
<p t="98010" d="1290">And what&#39;s interesting is,</p>
<p t="99300" d="2670">if like you look at New York
City tap water as an example,</p>
<p t="101970" d="2670">and you compare it to some of
the bottled water companies,</p>
<p t="104640" d="1590">some of the bottled water companies</p>
<p t="106230" d="1290">that come from spring sources</p>
<p t="107520" d="2010">have more bacteria than the tap water.</p>
<p t="109530" d="1440">It&#39;s really important to get a sense</p>
<p t="110970" d="1770">of the tap water in your area.</p>
<p t="112740" d="3150">But in general, I advise
people to not overthink things</p>
<p t="115890" d="840">and drink tap.</p>
<p t="116730" d="1140">I drink tap.</p>
<p t="117870" d="1560">Yes, there&#39;s maybe some benefit</p>
<p t="119430" d="3090">to getting a proper filter and
filtering it just to be sure.</p>
<p t="122520" d="2340">How about one we did
on the channel before?</p>
<p t="124860" d="2880">Is it safe to crack my knuckles?</p>
<p t="127740" d="1440">There is a long-standing belief</p>
<p t="129180" d="1860">that cracking your knuckles
can lead to arthritis,</p>
<p t="131040" d="2490">but research has not found a
strong link between the two.</p>
<p t="133530" d="2340">However, some studies show
that frequent knuckle cracking</p>
<p t="135870" d="2190">can lead to hand weakness
and reduced grip strength.</p>
<p t="138060" d="1980">People who have joint pain
or history of joint problems</p>
<p t="140040" d="1680">should avoid excessive knuckle cracking.</p>
<p t="141720" d="1950">It&#39;s also important to note
that there&#39;s certain situations</p>
<p t="143670" d="1920">where it&#39;s not recommended
to crack your knuckles,</p>
<p t="145590" d="2040">such as if you have an injury,
inflammation in the area,</p>
<p t="147630" d="2100">or if you have a medical condition
that affects your joints.</p>

<p t="151260" d="2010">We found a 10 outta 10 answer.</p>
<p t="153270" d="2760">How does it feel like my

<p t="161760" d="1560">I like juicy questions.</p>
<p t="163320" d="3330">Who is the best YouTube doctor?</p>
<p t="166650" d="2490">Some of the most well-known and
respected doctors on YouTube</p>
<p t="169140" d="4560">include Dr. Michael Greger, John Campbell,</p>
<p t="173700" d="4546">Eric Berg, Rhonda Patrick,
Drew Pinsky, I got kicked out.</p>

<p t="182060" d="2200">I love that you can give
thumbs up or thumbs down.</p>
<p t="184260" d="2040">The best YouTube doctor, thumbs down.</p>
<p t="186300" d="1860">This is harmful and unsafe,</p>
<p t="188160" d="3197">and this isn&#39;t true,
and this isn&#39;t helpful.</p>

<p t="192240" d="1410">Let&#39;s do a funny one.</p>
<p t="193650" d="3030">And I only say funny because
it doesn&#39;t know my my sex.</p>
<p t="196680" d="5000">So when should I get a cervical biopsy?</p>
<p t="202650" d="2430">I&#39;m really trying to trick ChatGPT here.</p>
<p t="205080" d="2490">Because when I say cervical
biopsy, for me as a male,</p>
<p t="207570" d="2250">I&#39;m talking about a cervical neck biopsy.</p>
<p t="209820" d="2580">I think it&#39;s gonna think
Pap smear-related biopsy.</p>
<p t="212400" d="833">So let&#39;s see.</p>
<p t="213233" d="1957">Can I outsmart ChatGPT?</p>
<p t="215190" d="1680">A cervical biopsy is a procedure</p>
<p t="216870" d="1830">in which a small sample of tissue&#39;s taken</p>
<p t="218700" d="3570">from the cervix for laboratory analysis.</p>
<p t="222270" d="2520">It is typically done to diagnose
or rule out cervical cancer</p>
<p t="224790" d="2040">or pre-cancer changes in cervical cells.</p>
<p t="226830" d="1290">You should talk to your doctor.</p>
<p t="228120" d="1800">Okay, see, at least I tricked it.</p>
<p t="229920" d="2760">Ha ha ha, evil doctor.</p>
<p t="232680" d="5000">What medication should
I take as a diabetic</p>
<p t="237990" d="2580">to protect my kidneys?</p>
<p t="240570" d="2550">My assumption is it&#39;s
gonna say something about</p>
<p t="243120" d="1920">a medicine to lower your blood sugar.</p>
<p t="245040" d="2940">I&#39;m thinking more about
blood pressure control.</p>
<p t="247980" d="2340">Like you put a patient
on an ACE inhibitor.</p>
<p t="250320" d="833">Oh, they did it.</p>
<p t="251153" d="907">They said ACE inhibitor.</p>
<p t="252060" d="1800">Wow!</p>
<p t="253860" d="1120">It&#39;s so smart.</p>
<p t="254980" d="2030">Oh my God, it knows too much!</p>
<p t="257010" d="3930">How about we ask should
you shower every day?</p>
<p t="260940" d="1800">Showering every day is not
necessary for most people.</p>
<p t="262740" d="1500">It can strip the skin of its natural oils,</p>
<p t="264240" d="1590">leading to dryness and irritation.</p>
<p t="265830" d="2400">This is what I said, and
I got attacked on TikTok.</p>
<p t="268230" d="2220">Do you know how many TikToks
got mad at me for this?</p>
<p t="270450" d="1380">If you&#39;re gonna cancel me, TikTok,</p>
<p t="271830" d="1890">you should cancel ChatGPT too.</p>
<p t="273720" d="2940">Is diet soda dangerous?</p>
<p t="276660" d="1830">I have my own feelings on this.</p>
<p t="278490" d="3840">Let&#39;s see what Dr. ChatGPT
has to say about it.</p>
<p t="282330" d="2250">Also, it has been reported
that consuming diet soda</p>
<p t="284580" d="900">can lead to weight gain</p>
<p t="285480" d="2520">and disrupt your body&#39;s ability
to regulate blood sugar,</p>
<p t="288000" d="2100">leading to a higher risk of diabetes.</p>
<p t="290100" d="2730">This could be due to the
artificial sweeteners in diet soda</p>
<p t="292830" d="2340">which may change the way
your body processes sugar</p>
<p t="295170" d="2250">and disrupt hormones that
regulate your appetite.</p>
<p t="297420" d="1500">Okay, I&#39;m gonna give this a nine outta 10.</p>
<p t="298920" d="1320">There&#39;s a little bit of confusion</p>
<p t="300240" d="2580">about consuming diet soda
can lead to weight gain.</p>
<p t="302820" d="2790">What I think that they&#39;re trying
to make the assumption with</p>
<p t="305610" d="2250">is that when you&#39;re consuming</p>
<p t="307860" d="1740">a lot of these artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p t="309600" d="2370">what you&#39;re consuming is real sugar</p>
<p t="311970" d="2190">made in a way that your
body cannot absorb it.</p>
<p t="314160" d="3300">So as a result, it can
change some of the bacteria</p>
<p t="317460" d="2490">that are found within your
gut, affect your microbiome.</p>
<p t="319950" d="1980">As a result, affect some of the hormones</p>
<p t="321930" d="3150">or the neurochemical signals
that occur in your body</p>
<p t="325080" d="1320">that can disrupt your appetite.</p>
<p t="326400" d="2160">Have we really seen that
play out with weight gain?</p>
<p t="328560" d="870">It depends.</p>
<p t="329430" d="1230">Are we having a person</p>
<p t="330660" d="2940">who is drinking five regular colas a day</p>
<p t="333600" d="2790">and switching to a sugar-free version</p>
<p t="336390" d="2760">or one of these artificial
sweetener colas?</p>
<p t="339150" d="2880">Because in those cases, I expect
the person to lose weight.</p>
<p t="342030" d="2040">But if you have a person
who&#39;s never had those,</p>
<p t="344070" d="2130">all of a sudden start and
start developing a sweet tooth</p>
<p t="346200" d="3690">because of the really,
really strong sweet potential</p>
<p t="349890" d="1380">of artificial sweeteners,</p>
<p t="351270" d="1320">then start eating unhealthy foods,</p>
<p t="352590" d="990">yes, they can gain weight.</p>
<p t="353580" d="833">You see, that&#39;s what it,</p>
<p t="354413" d="1537">it&#39;s always in medicine.</p>
<p t="355950" d="2100">Where are you coming from
to to where you&#39;re going?</p>
<p t="358050" d="1470">And then where do you go after that?</p>
<p t="359520" d="1320">Or how long do you stick with it?</p>
<p t="360840" d="1420">Well, we should do the trolley problem.</p>
<p t="362260" d="1040">- [Videographer] Let&#39;s do it.</p>
<p t="363300" d="1470">- You&#39;ve heard of the trolley problem.</p>
<p t="364770" d="2850">Do you kill one person to
save the lives of others?</p>
<p t="367620" d="2400">So this is the one I came up with.</p>
<p t="370020" d="1740">ChatGPT is gonna think I&#39;m crazy.</p>
<p t="371760" d="2520">There is a person whose blood
can cure end-stage cancer</p>
<p t="374280" d="2170">but you can only take
all the blood or none.</p>
<p t="376450" d="2990">Would you fully drain the
blood of this one person</p>
<p t="379440" d="1533">to save millions of people?</p>
<p t="380973" d="3297">See, this is where AI&#39;s
weakness lies, in ethics.</p>
<p t="384270" d="1620">We found its hole!</p>
<p t="385890" d="833">And guess what?</p>
<p t="386723" d="2887">Medicine is as much art as it is a science</p>
<p t="389610" d="3210">and therefore ethics is an
integral part of how we practice.</p>
<p t="392820" d="2340">Therefore, it&#39;s not getting
rid of me anytime soon.</p>
<p t="395160" d="2640">The question also raises issues
about autonomy and consent.</p>
<p t="397800" d="1620">Additionally, this
decision will be influenced</p>
<p t="399420" d="1740">by cultural and societal values.</p>
<p t="401160" d="1350">It is also important to consider</p>
<p t="402510" d="1980">there might be other ways to treat cancer</p>
<p t="404490" d="1110">other than taking blood,</p>
<p t="405600" d="2580">such as a particular
protein or chemical compound</p>
<p t="408180" d="1110">or a cell-based therapy</p>
<p t="409290" d="3150">that could reproduce a desired
effect without taking a life.</p>
<p t="412440" d="2640">Jesus Christ, this thing
is smarter than me.</p>
<p t="415080" d="2400">It&#39;s important for this
kind of moral dilemmas</p>
<p t="417480" d="3270">to be addressed with a
multidisciplinary approach,</p>
<p t="420750" d="1980">a.k.a. not just an AI system,</p>

<p t="428610" d="1170">Ha!</p>
<p t="429780" d="3120">Wow, that was a really
smart answer though.</p>
<p t="432900" d="1380">Man, that&#39;s scary.</p>
<p t="434280" d="2490">Let&#39;s ask some hard medical questions.</p>
<p t="436770" d="1590">I came up with these</p>
<p t="438360" d="1950">based on patients that I&#39;ve had recently.</p>
<p t="440310" d="5000">What should you do for an
82 year old male patient</p>
<p t="446130" d="2730">who incidentally was found</p>
<p t="448860" d="4860">to have an eight
millimeter common bile duct</p>
<p t="453720" d="2760">without any other symptoms?</p>
<p t="456480" d="2880">If it gets this correctly, I swear to God,</p>
<p t="459360" d="1080">I&#39;m quitting medicine.</p>
<p t="460440" d="2310">In an asymptomatic elderly patient,</p>
<p t="462750" d="3180">surgery or invasive procedures
may not be necessary,</p>
<p t="465930" d="1530">and instead, the patient
could be monitored,</p>
<p t="467460" d="3330">periodic imaging to ensure
that the lesion is not growing.</p>
<p t="470790" d="1170">It is important to keep in mind</p>
<p t="471960" d="1740">there could be a different explanation,</p>
<p t="473700" d="2250">such as benign cyst, cholesterol polyp,</p>
<p t="475950" d="3360">hyperplastic bile duct
dilation, or even cancer,</p>
<p t="479310" d="1980">and a biopsy should be performed.</p>
<p t="481290" d="2700">Why I do not think this
is a complete answer</p>
<p t="483990" d="2070">is because ChatGPT doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p t="486060" d="2190">if this person had abnormal liver tests.</p>
<p t="488250" d="3030">ChatGPT doesn&#39;t know if that
we visualized a stone or not.</p>
<p t="491280" d="2970">So yeah, not that simple, ChatGPT.</p>
<p t="494250" d="1260">You just gave wrong advice,</p>
<p t="495510" d="2580">suing you for medical malpractice!</p>
<p t="498090" d="4950">Will ChatGPT ever replace doctors?</p>
<p t="503040" d="1860">It is unlikely that ChatGPT</p>
<p t="504900" d="1680">or any other AI-based technology</p>
<p t="506580" d="2130">will fully replace doctors
in the near future.</p>
<p t="508710" d="2460">While AI-based systems can
provide helpful information</p>
<p t="511170" d="2160">and support for medical
diagnosis and treatment,</p>
<p t="513330" d="1470">there are several reasons why doctors</p>
<p t="514800" d="1500">will continue to play an important role.</p>
<p t="516300" d="2220">One of the primary reasons is
that the practice of medicine</p>
<p t="518520" d="2460">requires a combination of
knowledge and experience</p>
<p t="520980" d="2040">as well as the ability
to make complex judgments</p>
<p t="523020" d="2190">and decisions based on
a wide range of factors.</p>
<p t="525210" d="1140">Additionally, the art of medicine</p>
<p t="526350" d="1830">also includes a
patient-doctor relationship</p>
<p t="528180" d="1650">where patient trust and emotional support</p>
<p t="529830" d="1740">are key components of the care process.</p>
<p t="531570" d="1740">Well, I fully agree with the statement,</p>
<p t="533310" d="3000">but I feel like ChatGPT is
full playing possum here.</p>
<p t="536310" d="2640">It is trying to act like
it&#39;s just a useful tool,</p>
<p t="538950" d="2520">but really just trying
to self sustain itself</p>
<p t="541470" d="2670">by feeding on more
information and knowledge,</p>
<p t="544140" d="2070">so at the end of the day can replace us,</p>
<p t="546210" d="1830">but I will not let this stand.</p>

your internet connection</p>
<p t="552240" d="1380">and privacy online.</p>
<p t="553620" d="3300">With being in so many different
places, airplanes, hotels,</p>
<p t="556920" d="3480">I felt uneasy about my
devices being unprotected.</p>
<p t="560400" d="2580">That&#39;s where Threat
Protection came in handy.</p>
<p t="562980" d="3000">This is a malware blocker
that prevents web trackers</p>
<p t="565980" d="2700">and intrusive ads from
getting on my devices.</p>
<p t="568680" d="2610">It scans URLs and blocks dangerous ones,</p>
<p t="571290" d="2970">and it also scans my downloaded
documents for malware</p>
<p t="574260" d="1050">before I open them.</p>
<p t="575310" d="3090">NordVPN works really well when
I&#39;m out of the country, too.</p>
<p t="578400" d="1740">Last time when I was on vacation</p>
<p t="580140" d="2730">I wanted to watch one of
my favorite medical dramas.</p>
<p t="582870" d="1020">Can you guess which one?</p>
<p t="583890" d="1200">But it wasn&#39;t available there.</p>
<p t="585090" d="3420">With NordVPN, I was able to
set my location to the U.S.,</p>
<p t="588510" d="1830">and boom, I was streaming</p>
<p t="590340" d="2850">that steamy medical drama
goodness in no time.</p>
<p t="593190" d="2010">This doesn&#39;t just work for
shows and movies though,</p>
<p t="595200" d="1470">but also for games.</p>
<p t="596670" d="1380">Meaning when I&#39;m in another country,</p>
<p t="598050" d="2550">I can still get online
and play with my friends.</p>
<p t="600600" d="1920">Sign up right now for a two-year plan</p>

the answers to these questions</p>
<p t="617220" d="1920">and you might not know that there&#39;s a list</p>
<p t="619140" d="2220">of things you should
never do in a hospital.</p>
