I‚Äôve actually been on the hunt for something extremely simple but is incredibly hard to come across and that is a good pepperoni. I do have my spots to grab a NY slice with pepperoni but it would be great if real pepperoni was offered in Tokyo and not a thin sliced salami that is sometimes called pepperoni. The other crave I have which may not exist in the napolitano style is the ‚Äúno flop‚Äù.  I do have a hidden spot that I hit that has a ‚ÄúBismarck‚Äù napolitano style with a little crunch with white sauce, white asparagus, nama ham, buffalo mozzarella and egg in the center.
