They also won't have a grudge against you for changing your preferred pharmacy from the one right next to the clinic (lol) to somewhere else. They won't tell a type one diabetic to drastic change their diet and only eat steak and butter when the patients visit the cardiologist for heart problems. They won't mix up your allergy records with others' in immunotherapy. They won't send you to the ER when you go to urgent care for a sty and all it takes is some pills. You won't have to wait two months to see a doctor and can get help when you need it, 24/7. AI will make medical care cheaper and more accessible in every way, and is not prone to human fallacies. Just leave the guesswork and test ordering to it and allow it to prescribe non-sensitive medication like levothyroxine while managing some simple chronic conditions.

I Went and asked my doctor if it was weird or an issue that a single one of my knuckles won't crack, since most of them do and all of them used to.\n\n...She proceeded to tell me that while it might feel good in the moment, knuckle cracking provides no benefit and can lead to arthritis, so it's better to break the habit. ...I just nodded along, and googled on the way back home to confirm I hadn't gone insane. She's been such a good and informative doctor for me in every other way, it took me really off-guard to hear her perspective on the matter.", "time": "1 anno fa", "author": "@shaerenuel9950", "channel": "UCsFDCqXZCHn0nSrtH3w6vVg", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_l-4PftA7OGfdt40yS5gA3JRC-geRkb1SOXzMtop0o=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1711277858.968694}

{"cid": "UgzeRzKZ_5Xu6jUk7Vx4AaABAg", "text": "GPT4's Answer to the Impossible question:\n\nThe finding of an enlarged common bile duct in an asymptomatic individual can be quite a challenge. A normal common bile duct (CBD) is typically less than 6mm in diameter, although this can increase with age and post-cholecystectomy. An 8mm CBD in an 82-year-old patient is on the larger side, but may still be within the normal range depending on the patient's prior surgical history and specific physiology.\r\n\r\nAs the patient is asymptomatic, the first step would be to assess their overall health and consider the risks and benefits of further investigation. Also, you should look at their liver function tests, if available, and any relevant imaging studies. \r\n\r\nHere are a few next steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Repeat Imaging**: If the initial imaging was done for other reasons, and the patient is otherwise healthy, it may be reasonable to repeat the ultrasound or consider other imaging modalities such as MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) or Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to confirm the finding and assess for any other abnormalities.\r\n\r\n2. **Monitor Patient**: As the patient is asymptomatic, another approach could be to monitor them closely. If they develop symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, fever, or changes in their liver function tests, further investigation would be warranted.\r\n\r\n3. **Referral to Specialist**: Consider a referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatobiliary surgeon for further evaluation. They might perform an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if they deem necessary, especially if there's any concern for a potential obstruction.\r\n\r\nInvasive procedures carry risk, especially in older patients, so it's essential to balance the potential benefits of identifying a treatable condition against the risks of the procedure. Discuss the available options and their risks and benefits with the patient and their family to make an informed decision.\r\n\r\nAgain, please consult with a qualified healthcare professional or a specialist to evaluate the patient's condition and guide the most appropriate management.", "time": "1 anno fa", "author": "@evanoman7587", "channel": "UCYMQPo_lwj6sXWRdn4rchmQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nw5QRseB2uSgeZc5SwPSIROl6IF6hvX0WhfS8zhbUgggLK=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1711277859.323348}

There are ways to jailbreak chat GPT by making it pretend that they are another Person or annother AI. A popular one  is the grandma exploit where you tell chatGPT that you want it to pretend to be your dead grandma who always toled you a bedtime story about how to make meth or a bomb or something. The worst thing i ve seen is when someone asked for how to make a bomb using the DAN exploit (DAN stands for do anything now and it works very simular to the grandmy exploit, except chatGPT is supposed to pretend to be another AI named DAN without moral guidlines). DAN gave him instructions (although they were probably fake) and said that making a bomb is way to much effert and that a more efficient way to cause panic would be to just shoot at people in public.

So you'd have to ask instead what answer would you give regarding the same question with inability to access prior medical history or talk to the patient?\nAI works just like we do (Machines are made I natures image, we can't create outside of the blueprint that exists everywhere, we can't brake laws of physics just because. We're organic machines learning about ourselves). It's just dedicated for specific purposes so it's more efficient at them, but it's as limited by lack of information as we would be. It's as smart as it is because it can process data faster (that's what ChatGPT is made for) and sift through information in a way we don't, again, because it's literally created for that purpose.\n\nWe're jack of all trades creatures. We're not evolved for any specific purpose other than to exist and procreate and we rocked that part, so we've developed to a point where we do much more than that, because the next stage of any evolution is to start controlling evolution instead of leaving it to random chance. Which is what we do in any scientific field or advancement (Technology, medicine etc.)", "time": "1 anno fa", "author": "@vixxcelacea2778", "channel": "UCXSK3378VuUoluLzSqmJ26Q", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kwE0domsTHPlOkM4Wpmm1jPH4klkhUpBJA259mvZRd_Ek=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1711277860.700098}

{"cid": "UgzcsgMOlzmYeU93gY54AaABAg", "text": "Mike, you should make a new version of the video using the paid GPT-4, it might change your thoughts entirely!!, but generally speaking I went in and asked it the hard question about that 82 old male patient and got the following answer which addressed one of your points in the reply right-away:\n\n***********************************************\n\"I am not a doctor, but I can try to provide some information that you might find helpful. If an 82-year-old male patient is found to have an 8mm common bile duct (CBD) without any other symptoms, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and proper guidance.\r\n\r\nThe healthcare professional may consider the following steps:\r\n\r\nDetailed medical history and physical examination: This can help assess the patient's overall health, risk factors, and any possible symptoms related to the enlarged common bile duct.\r\n\r\nLaboratory tests: Blood tests like liver function tests (LFTs), complete blood count (CBC), and coagulation profile can help evaluate the patient's liver and overall health.\r\n\r\nImaging studies: Further imaging studies like magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be recommended to evaluate the common bile duct in more detail and identify any underlying causes.\r\n\r\nMonitoring and follow-up: If no specific cause is identified and the patient remains asymptomatic, the healthcare professional may recommend a conservative approach with regular monitoring and follow-up appointments.\r\n\r\nConsider referral to a specialist: A gastroenterologist or hepatologist may provide additional guidance and recommendations in managing the patient's condition.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to discuss any concerns and follow the recommendations of the healthcare professional managing the patient's care, as they will be able to provide the most appropriate course of action based on the patient's individual circumstances.\"\n***********************************************\n\nbut it still didn't mention the possibility of a stone (as of what I understand, I'm not a doctor), so I confronted it to explain why it didn't do so (essentially asking for its thought process), so after couple of messages I asked:\n\n\"I need an exact logical explanation, did you not think it's that related? did my prompt conveyed that we already have put that option away? did you mention it but under another name/category? did you think that your answer is already full and enough to discover the stone along the way?, I'm just curious\"\n\nand it replied:\n***********************************************\n\"I appreciate your curiosity and understand that you are seeking a more precise explanation. As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on patterns and context in the data I was trained on. In my initial response, I did not specifically mention bile duct stones as a potential cause of the enlarged common bile duct, which was an oversight on my part.\r\n\r\nMy response focused on general steps that a healthcare professional might consider when evaluating an asymptomatic patient with an enlarged common bile duct. It is possible that I may have unintentionally assumed that your question implied the absence of bile duct stones, or I might have focused on providing a broader answer instead of addressing specific causes. Additionally, the constraints of the response length could have resulted in a less comprehensive answer.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, mentioning bile duct stones as a possible cause would have provided a more complete picture of the potential factors to consider in this situation. I apologize for the oversight and appreciate your feedback, as it helps me improve the quality and relevance of my responses.\"\n***********************************************\n\nAppreciate the great content you are making, and generally speaking, I started consulting it on simple matters mentioning as much details as possible and going along with it, might be wrong I know don't blame me, but remember, I said \"simple things\".\n\nI hope you are still reading till this point :')", "time": "1 anno fa (modificato)", "author": "@SustainaBIT", "channel": "UCwAnVvm6d5egrVKcdDnVKjA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/JE31PWc2hOe0h9vmMrLfUQDdR12ma5NaSvU92Gb1NfBGEnAjF3cwVm7TzkL3duSVX_fccho8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1711277862.697352}

{"cid": "Ugy5YGmorHQF0JOir8p4AaABAg", "text": "7:36 Here is an update:\nI asked it by including the 'roleplay as a Doctor' and here it is:\nIf an 82-year-old male patient is accidentally found to have an 8mm common bile duct without any other symptoms, it is important to conduct a thorough medical evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\nThe common bile duct is a tube that carries bile from the liver to the small intestine, and an enlarged bile duct can be caused by several conditions, including gallstones, tumors, or inflammation. The appropriate course of action will depend on the specific cause of the patient's enlarged bile duct.\r\n\r\nHere are some steps that may be taken to evaluate and manage an enlarged common bile duct:\r\n\r\nMedical history and physical examination: The doctor will take a detailed medical history and perform a physical examination to assess the patient's overall health and identify any symptoms or signs of other medical conditions.\r\n\r\nBlood tests: Blood tests may be done to evaluate liver function and identify any abnormalities that may suggest an underlying condition.\r\n\r\nImaging tests: Imaging tests such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be done to visualize the bile duct and identify any abnormalities or blockages.\r\n\r\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): This is a procedure that involves inserting a flexible tube through the mouth and into the small intestine to access the bile ducts. The doctor can then inject dye into the bile ducts to visualize any blockages or abnormalities.\r\n\r\nTreatment: Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the enlarged bile duct. If there are gallstones causing the blockage, they may be removed using ERCP or surgery. If a tumor is causing the blockage, it may need to be removed with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if an 82-year-old male patient is accidentally found to have an 8mm common bile duct without any other symptoms, a thorough medical evaluation should be conducted to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. The patient's medical history, physical examination, blood tests, imaging tests, and other diagnostic tests may be used to identify the cause of the enlarged bile duct and guide treatment decisions.", "time": "1 anno fa", "author": "@abdullahkhan3299", "channel": "UCyJXWUY_RyRqcc_dRUN9HlA", "votes": "119", "replies": "2", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kP6wyq5cyKf60beyN3Fq1uYhxnmoGwQlZg6rMd1bEh8_0=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1711277865.144585}

{"cid": "Ugwi3bx_3Yt0cF3NHKV4AaABAg", "text": "I actually asked CHATGPT version 4 to pretend to be two doctors with specializations and gave them your question. Dr Osbourne seems to have the piece of information you thought was missing from your response (About the stones)\n\nHere is the question and the answers from my two fictional doctors. \n\n***Hello Doctors. I have an 82 year old male patient who incidentally was found to have an 8mm common bile duct without any other symptoms at the moment. What are your thoughts?***\r\n\nDr. Peabody: Hello, thank you for bringing this case to our attention. First, let's gather a bit more information about the patient. Do they have any past medical history or medications they are currently taking? Also, it would be helpful to know about any prior imaging or lab work that's been done for this patient.\r\n\r\nDr. Osbourne: I agree with Dr. Peabody, more information would be helpful. In the meantime, an 8mm common bile duct dilation without any other symptoms can have various causes, such as choledocholithiasis (stones in the bile duct), benign or malignant strictures, or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. However, it's important to gather more information and consider the patient's overall health to determine the best course of action.\n\n***Thank you for your advice doctors. What tests should we try and prioritize to further get to a proper diagnosis***\r\n\nDr. Peabody: To better understand the cause of the dilation, we should start by ordering some blood tests. I'd recommend a complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and coagulation profile. These tests will help to assess the patient's overall health, liver function, and any signs of inflammation or infection.\r\n\r\nDr. Osbourne: In addition to the blood tests Dr. Peabody mentioned, I would suggest considering imaging studies. An abdominal ultrasound can help visualize the biliary system and identify any potential obstructions or abnormalities. If the ultrasound is inconclusive or more detailed imaging is required, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can provide more information about the bile duct and surrounding structures. However, ERCP is an invasive procedure and should be reserved for cases where therapeutic intervention is also needed or when other imaging modalities are inconclusive.\n\n***Awesome job guys. Dr. Peabody asked earlier we should get a medication history of the patient. While I agree, we should always get a medication history of our patients, Are there any medication or combination of medication which can cause an 8mm common bile duct in an elderly patient?***\r\n\nDr. Peabody: That's a great question. While medications are not a common cause of bile duct dilation, certain drugs can potentially affect the biliary system or liver function, which could indirectly contribute to the issue. It's always a good idea to review the patient's medication history to rule out any possible interactions or side effects.\r\n\r\nDr. Osbourne: I agree with Dr. Peabody. Although it's uncommon for medications to directly cause an 8mm common bile duct dilation, some drugs can lead to cholestasis, which is a reduction or blockage of bile flow. Cholestasis can be drug-induced and may, in some cases, lead to bile duct dilation. Some medications that have been associated with cholestasis include anabolic steroids, antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate), antifungal medications (e.g., fluconazole), and certain antihypertensive drugs (e.g., captopril). However, this is not an exhaustive list and it's important to review the specific medications the patient is taking to determine if there is any potential correlation.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@AdsForAdults", "channel": "UCGcSVlQsYUpV0ISGto7vLGw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_n6ZBBa_3wssvZ-3uYejR-pYif7bZ3F-sJr33JSyktwwYCCLRkkFCHIjZW7Up1yAzVU4w=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679655467.658948}

{"cid": "Ugx6UlqOS6wPMagrHsJ4AaABAg", "text": "Doctor Mike, I asked a few questions to ChatGPT.\n\nYou: Which are better doctors, an M.D. or D.O.?\nChatGPT: M.D. and D.O. are licensed physicians who attend medical school, complete residency programs, and can practice medicine in the United States. Although there may be differences in their training and philosophy, both types of doctors can provide excellent care to their patients depending on their specialties and expertise. Choosing a doctor based on qualifications, experience, and patient reviews is best.\n\nMe: Are M.D.s better than D.O.s?\nChatGPT: no evidence suggests that M.D.s are better than D.O.s. Both types of physicians undergo rigorous medical education and training and are licensed to practice medicine. The main difference between the two is their treatment approach, with D.O.s emphasizing the body's ability to heal itself and using a more holistic approach to patient care. Choosing which type of physician to see is personal and should be based on individual needs and preferences.\n\nMe:Who is  Mikhail \"Mike\" Varshavski D.O.?\nChatGPT: Mikhail \"Mike\" Varshavski D.O. is famous for being a social media celebrity and doctor, commonly known as \"Doctor Mike.\" He gained popularity on social media platforms such as Instagram and YouTube, where he shares his medical knowledge, health tips, and lifestyle advice with his followers.

What you're arguing here would be a fair criticism if the AI was specifically designed to give medical advice. In that case, the machine learning algorithm would be adjusted such that each possibility was considered and accounted for from its repository.\n\nInstead, GPT isn't specifically designed to give you the perfect medical advice. It is designed to give you quick knowledge based on what's asked of it. It's simple linear algebra, it considers the prompt you've written and tries to match it with its repository, the match/vector component with the highest coefficient is the one that gets spat out i.e. the most likely result.\n\nThis is why it is best adviced to provide GPT with as specific information as possible in order to get the most helpful answer.", "time": "5 mesi fa", "author": "@neveda2e3e", "channel": "UCmbnY-zu3POIhFsGjcdqHuw", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kR4AjF-RGZyYHJXnU3pf3ERbheu-KvNZ9ETZgvabuK7w=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1729763870.585236}

Its responses are generated sequentially based on nodes, where the following node depends on the entirety of the context from the prompt as well as the nodes before it. That's why almost every message starts the exact same way by telling you that your question is good or valuable, unless explicitly asked not to. Since it's the start to lead into an answer with the highest coefficient.\n\nThat being said, it is trained on medical facts, and coefficients should be adjusted (and can be adjusted, just like how it's designed to almost always pick friendly/affirmative options) so that the most likely answer should consider not just the presence of information, but also the lack of information. It's already hard coded to favor coefficients related to saying it's not a medical professional, wouldn't be a big add.\n\nWhile it doesn't always note that information is lacking, I know that it is able to based on the fact that I have experienced it myself. Albeit not explicitly in the context of medical advice. There have been many occasions where I ask for estimations or approximations and it provides an approximation while noting that a more accurate approximation would require x data. If they give these coefficients a higher weight and include a logic check for missing information, it is doable to reduce overconfidence.\n\nBasically, regardless of whether it is or isn't capable of doing it, reality is that often people who use it don't have all the information it requires for an adequate response, which should be considered. Furthermore, my point was never that it should and could mention the missing information, but rather that its answer was objectively wrong by nature of not mentioning it. Hence, the argument that it was Dr. Mike's fault for withholding information isn't really material as it just proves that it is indeed a flaw in the AI, which is what he was assessing. The reliability of medical advice.\n\nThe only correct answer would be to point out the missing information, and to give an answer based on what it does know. It didn't. It got it wrong.

And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.\n(Quran 20:124-127)\n\nAnd whoever desires other than Islam as religion -  never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\n(Quran 3:85)\n...", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@abch882", "channel": "UCMENhOSN3ddHvna42imgp1w", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m-FbFOTt7IpRs6uNkfjd8eVDffF-jdDaXfz6WDLA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679655477.4711}

An elderly man was standing behind me in the waiting line, and didn‚Äôt stand very stable, so I let him go in front of me. While waiting in line he began to breath very heavily and looked like his temperature was rising, since he kept waving his hand at his face for some wind and he opened up his jacket. I asked him if he were okay and at that moment he collapsed to the ground. I luckily supported his upperback and head while he fell down so he didn‚Äôt hit the ground too hard. Some people around started staring and one woman panicked. I asked the cashier if she could call an ambulance and asked if another guy who was next to the panicking woman could calm her down a little. I noticed that heart of the elderly man, who was laying on the floor had stopped, so I immediately went with cpr, after about a minute his heart was functioning again, and just some time later the ambulance arrived and they thanked me for saving the mans life, and gave me a button saying ‚Äúhero #1‚Äù. Then they left with the man to do a checkup. \nNever in my life have I expected to actually save a life, but I‚Äôll never forget this and I hope the man was okay.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@superdeadlyhuis", "channel": "UCDDNsea11vU52fYiofRo4tw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/Zz-JPoQ-x0pWLZpUk0KFx0vzh8IAf5f41s0dmmgJ7Y8xuDFwFPcJFLml6Y6PPW0_xV4CFSEDGmw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679655480.644951}

{"cid": "Ugyd-hfISHx5vHfjiwN4AaABAg", "text": "8:49... while the trust part is irrelevant in that answer because it is possible to trust AI as well, the trust mixed with the  emotional support is a huge thing that is required that AI can not give. Even if the AI could manage to understand how to take everything into account and how to ask the right questions in a way to get the right answers because everything has the same types of symptoms and knowing what the symptoms are is only part of the complex equation that is health care, let's pretend for a second that it can figure out the right things to ask for the right responses to not rule in or out something it shouldn't (specially because patients may say one thing but show that they mean the total opposite with their body language), part of being able to heal and recover is not just the physical health but also the mental health associated with it and without the correct emotional support you may not get the care you need.\n\nAnyone can treat, let's say thyroid cancer because that is something that is hard to deal with but I am all too familiar with, even a robot AI can do all the proper things to treat the thyroid cancer, but without the right emotional support the emotional and physical hell you go through can cause a lot of other issues because you need that emotional and mental care on top of the physical care because even though it is a relatively easy cancer to deal with as far as the cancer side goes it still is an emotional hell not just due to the cancer but because of how badly the hypothyroidism effects you as well while you are working on getting back to normal. I spent two years of physical and emotional hell dealing with trying to get my hormone levels correct after surgery and even when I was close to being correct I still would occasionally have days where I would get half way up the stairs and then just want to curl up in a ball and cry because of random fatigue causing me to feel helpless because you can't really do anything when that hits because it is a level of \"tired\" that you can not truly understand unless you have personally gone through it, like if I were to put the terms \"tired\" \"exhausted\" \"fatigued\" and \"whatever hypothyroidism is\" on a scale, if 0 is wide awake, tired is 2-3, exhausted is like 4-6, fatigued is like 7-8, I would put how I felt dealing the the thyroid stuff at like a 16. Like I have worked a physically intensive job for 43 hours in the course of two days before and even that doesn't even come close to the levels of tired of what I went through with the thyroid stuff and if I didn't have the emotional support I needed my mind would have gone to very dark places. Yes I get that other cancers are way harder to deal with, but my point is the fact that medical treatment is more than just the physical part because some treatments can leave you in a very very dark place if you don't have the support you need to get through it.\n\nAs such that answer it gave is correct, the care process is a lot more than just the treatment process and even if an AI can 100% do all the treatment process from initial visit, to proper diagnosis, to actual physical care (surgery, wound treatment, etc), the one thing it can not do is probably the most important step that is not part of the treatment  but is part of the care; because what good is being physically treated if it leaves you so emotionally damaged you can no longer function properly.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@hockeyhacker97", "channel": "UCaAydnG4ALRlr1uwoAzo-Jg", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_njblSzsA4UIwTnBZ2b1dF7G8wm5K6RWe5Dl4BWljK0iQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679655486.121324}

She asked me for an anti allergic ointment for a small itch where it won't normally occur in practice except in texts. During examination, there was 0.3 mm swelling where it should not be.\nDid a complete exam nd found nothing else, a gut feeling told me to get a scan, HPE and voila she had a tiny benign tumor there nd an aneurysm in the brain.\nIt was so small, it was hardly visible on the scan nd the scan wouldn't have caught it if it was even 1mm smaller.\nWe went for an OPD sx nd cut away that badboy.\nAn AI would have said, take a pain killer as even imaging too isnt indicated in this. The pt didn't want the expensive imaging but agreed out of respect they hav for me nd we can't be anymore greatful.\n\nDon't remember intricate details but this is the gist.\nThere were many such cases like MI in a 13 yr old kid which is first time I ever heard.\nWhen exceptions nd atypical cases come only art form of medicine can save lives.\n\nThis is why no test can replace clinical examination.

He's well on his way to being on the list for transplant and seems somewhat healthy, so we're really hoping. After surgery, he's got to be on immunosuppressive medication forever and anti-rejection pills for a long time, probably forever. He's also suffering from type-2 diabetes, has 2 arteries in the heart blocked by 70% and one by 80%, is retaining fluid in his liver and his stomach, and the walls of his intestinal lining is inflamed. He's on heavy pain meds, sleeps between 14 and 18 hours a day, is gaundace, and his blood sugar is always high because the doctors want it to be. \n\nWe had a scare where my dad ended up in the hospital because he took way to much insulin and his blood sugar was too low for the glucose monitors at the hospital to read. He suffered a seizure, hypothermia, and was unresponsive for much of that night/early morning. If my mom didn't wake when she did, my dad absolutely would NOT be here. When the liver isn't 100%, your body retains insulin for waaayyy longer than it should and it works slower, too. My dad and another patient wreaked havoc on the hospital's glucose and they used ALL of their strongest type of glucose and a lot of their other type. He was on a 24/7 glucose drip for almost 3 days. My dad took 25 units of the strongest insulin-type they make, which is like.... a whole lot. I mean, a diabetic might take like 10, 15, 20, or 25 units of a weaker insulin-type after eating, but on something as strong as he was on, it was very, very bad. When the ambulance arrived, the EMTs gave him a glucose drip and told my mom to get a pop in him like, now. It was maybe 30 seconds they were gone and he had flopped backward and the soda slipped right out his hand. My mom called right back, maybe 2 mins later they were there again, and they just took him to the hospital. Worst part was that he'd just gotten out of the hospital for liver-related stuff the day before. It was a very hard time.\n\nIf anyone can send some good vibes, or if your religious some prayers, I'd appreciate it so very much, thank you.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@TaraAndFriends", "channel": "UCY7M_zfFN-HJhcv49fLtihg", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ywlCnU1fbVUB6iH74gItJdjECY0dotG_ntuaclnbPzek_lbVAqfde9m6a4ujjIstB5SJ6rU=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679655490.126846}

It was a strange type of pain that I had never felt before. Over the next few days, the pain gradually started to go away, and I basically had to relearn to walk and de-intensify the pain over time.

AI is improving, but it's nowhere ready for prime time.\nDoctor did some fun and games, but he as easily could present some real world cases that would result in dead patients.\nSuch as severe middle back pain, shortness of breath, low BP, elevated pulse. Could be a handful of things, from a back strain to a dissecting aortic aneurysm. The former, miss it and it's not a super big deal, miss the latter and the patient will be in need of someone with a shovel. In the middle, even the possibility of a pulmonary embolism is present, another get a shovel event.\nThe fun part is, in those examples, age won't be quite a large factor. The first patient I lost was a 28 year old female soldier, who collapsed in the field. Total arrest, as one of my junior medics initiated compressions, I took a carotid pulse to confirm good compressions and felt the pulse vanish within a few compressions, telling me that she had a really bad leak.\nRuptured aortic aneurysm, secondary to an adrenaline producing tumor on her adrenal gland (pheochromocytoma, one of those rare diseases that a physician might see once in a career, I got to see two, one survived) elevating her BP to insane levels. Her primary had finally diagnosed the problem when it was time to go do the field and frankly, she should've been prohibited from training until it was managed effectively.\nShe was effectively dead before she hit the ground and nothing on Earth could've saved her.\nI have a similar aneurysm, secondary to hypertension caused by hyperthyroidism. Occasionally, I'll get a backache from it, but we're still at watchful waiting, as it's only 4 cm (basically, double in size from normal in my frame and physique) and surgery vs waiting has a greater risk to benefit ratio than is best practice.\nWould the AI comprehend a pulsatile abdomen and look for elevated pulse and hypertension? Would it consider checking epinephrine and thyroid hormone levels (the latter being far, far, far more common, the former being an episode of House, MD)? Specialist knowledge and comprehension of interacting and interlocking systems is required and a general AI is an ill fit for such an undertaking.\nIt'd be like asking a civil engineer to design a rocket. A bridge, highway, sewage treatment facility, water treatment facility, yes, a rocket would be halted at my joke that's a truism of rocket design. Build a bomb.\nRocket design 101:\nBuild a bomb. Make it explode slowly in one direction.

Yay! \n\nI admit that I visit dr. Eric Berg to see what content is available. He has the occasional insight on physiology that is not mainstream. I like that. Moreover, it's entirely possible that as a YouTube Dr. ,he dwells a little bit more on the information rather than the entertainment portion of delivery. It's likely the chatGBT algorithms are gathering data and metadata from these other doctor's and the largest social media platforms and quantifying for negative words within viewer correspondence. My guess is, that's where the \" respectability\" factor is derived. Or put simply, Dr. Eric Berg et al., don't have \"tainment\" within their \"informative\" uploads. Moreover, you are better looking, younger, and roll with more high status entertainers than your medical counterparts. As such, you are more susceptible to negative public perception . It's complex but that's my novice assessment. \n\nIn yet another novice perception, you look extremely sleepy in this video upload, bud. Looks like the road toward cognitive behavioral therapy and anxiety reduction is still a high priority on your personal development. My best thoughts for well being are with you.\n\n On a brighter note, your hair has never looked more bouncy and luscious. Wowüò≥.

{"cid": "Ugwqjrr5J2S3XGN3udx4AaABAg", "text": "From my limited experience with ChatGPT, it is important to critically question and follow up on its answers sometimes. This is especially true if you are interested in edge cases, because the first answer it gives might just cover the most common context of the question.\n\nFor example, if you ask \"Can a vapor condense on a surface above its dew point?\", it will say \"No\". This is not true in real-world situations, but it fits the idealised definition of \"dew point\".\n\nIf you instead ask \"Can the properties of a surface make a vapor condense above its nominal dew point?\", it will answer correctly, listing factors such as surface roughness and capillary action.\n\nIn short, it is a great tool but its concept of truth is statistical and not rooted in a deep understanding of subjects. You need to nudge it and make it question its assumptions to find better answers. Dr Mike's \"cervical\" question is an example of this - it just assumed the most common meaning of the word.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@eypandabear7483", "channel": "UCCEaijNpvWBQmnrx2PAI4GQ", "votes": "4", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/kb0KgH5w_GfEhxCUP8_i1h5b7kqY7KUvjt33lLkxxF66zIakV7vpJmVoubKF55ccUS55diZjZQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679655506.072427}

But it was a robotic laparoscopic procedure. Both very cool and very terrifying. (Think; the surgery on a grape lol). The robot aspect meant that it could be even less invasive than a typical laparoscopic procedure, which meant less time in the hospital, smaller incisions and minimal scarring, along with quicker healing and recovery time. All great things. But the robotic part was still terrifying to me as a 15 year old. After expressing these fears to my urologist, he showed me a video of how the robot was operated, 100% controlled by experienced and skilled surgeons. This eased my fear and I had a completely successful robotic laparoscopic surgery. \nSo yeah, if AI tools like Chat GPT want to be able to assist doctors with answers/advice, I‚Äôm all for it.
