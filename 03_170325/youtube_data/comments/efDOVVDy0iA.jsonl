{"cid": "UgywtPrY8Kvsar-7Jdh4AaABAg", "text": "Welcome to China, where you can explore and experience the real China firsthand. This is a brief summary of my video, and if there are any areas that need improvement, feel free to share your feedback.\n\n01-When traveling in China, it's essential to carry your passport, as you will need identification for things like taking the train or purchasing park tickets (Chinese citizens usually carry their ID cards, and even if they forget to bring them, knowing their ID number can suffice. We also have electronic ID cards, but their use is not yet widespread).\r\n02-Google is difficult to use in China, and Google Maps is not updated promptly in the country. Typically, people in China use Amap (Gaode Maps) or Baidu Maps for navigation.\n03-China is very safe, and pedestrians are usually happy to help you. If you need assistance, you can also ask the police. It's perfectly fine for women to go out alone, as the safety level in China is extremely high.\n04-When traveling, it's responsible to buy insurance for yourself. It's a way of taking care of your own well-being.\n05-China's ride-hailing app is Didi, which is similar to Uber and very convenient. In fact, many years ago, Didi acquired Uber's China operations.\n06-Of course, for apps like maps, ride-hailing, and translation, you'll need a SIM card. Both of Beijing's airports offer SIM card sales services. After landing, you can ask any staff member, and they will guide you to the appropriate store to purchase a SIM card.\n07-When visiting China, you must experience a high-speed rail (HSR) trip. With a maximum speed of 350 km/h, the high-speed rail network connects every city in China. Experiencing the world's largest and fastest high-speed rail network will be a wonderful experience. (Of course, don't forget that you'll need your passport to take the high-speed train.)\n08-China currently has a population of 1.4 billion, and there are many travelers during holidays. So, it's best to avoid traveling during Chinese holidays for a more comfortable experience. Of course, you can first visit some less popular destinations and wait until after the holidays to visit famous attractions, making your trip more enjoyable by avoiding the peak crowds.（The best season to visit Beijing is during September and October.It's best to avoid July and August, as it's the summer vacation period and the hottest time of the year.）\n09-Since 2024, China's visa policies have seen significant changes and relaxations. Please make sure to visit the relevant websites to check the latest updates before your trip.\n10-I recommend trying the local cuisine from different regions of China. However, if you find the food unfamiliar, don't worry—Chinese cities are full of familiar Western chains like KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, and Starbucks, so you'll never have to worry about going hungry.\n11-It is recommended to book international hotels, which can be easily found on booking websites. If necessary, you can call the hotel in advance to confirm whether they accept foreign travelers.\n12-In China, credit cards are rarely used, and mobile electronic payments dominate everyday transactions. Even cash payments are becoming less common. Therefore, it's highly recommended to learn how to use Alipay or WeChat Pay, as these mobile payment platforms make transactions incredibly convenient during your stay in China.", "time": "5 mesi fa", "author": "@Power-Battery", "channel": "UCE-ml2qRcc0jCSrUfbvam0w", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nkHMdD8-iph0EM_9XXOHFTX5yr1_08Pyl5RsRmTC8NcKJnWauEhfigEgk72JRwumN-OA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1729153569.215549}
