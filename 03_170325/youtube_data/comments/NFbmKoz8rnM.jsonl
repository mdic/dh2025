There is no law against children getting married to adults, as long as the parents consent to it. I remember an article about child marriages and I think the youngest bride was only 4 and the groom was 60-70. Parents were desperate/greedy for money and agreed to allow their preschooler to get married and the husband would not permit her to continue school. 20 years later when the husband died, the now adult wife was forced to go looking for work with only a preschool education and 3 kids she was forced to have before she was 16.\n\nWhen the children do want to break free, they are then returned to their spouses. There are cases where the adult is abusive to their child bride/groom and the police are forced to return them to the abusers because they are the child's legal guardian.\n\nMany child brides and grooms can be divorced from their spouse when they became \"too old\" for them. When they are free, they may have no support and depending on their education level, may not be able to get a job.\n\nEven harder on them if the girls are forced to get pregnant and can be kicked out with the kids, if the husband chooses. Or a child is forced to become a mother/father to their spouse's children that maybe the same age or just barely younger than them.
