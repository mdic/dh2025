I think if you look back on the script of this video, you will see how tone deaf some of your comments are. Being self-aware about how rich you are doesn’t change the fact that saying things like “it is what it is“ about the price gouging on varied and nutritional foods is extremely dismissive of the real problems that people in poverty face. Let’s just be honest, six years ago when you were “poor” you were not “poor“ enough to not have access to a nice kitchen to make food, or time enough to make and edit YouTube videos to get started. You are blessed, and that is wonderful, but the systems in the United States and many other countries around the world are in place to keep people poor, keep them sick, and keep them paying large industries for convenience or healthcare. In my opinion, many of your words throughout this video are filtered through unintentional, ignorance, or unintentional cowardice. With a position and a platform like yours, taking a firm stance on your opinions would go a long way. Instead of saying that fruits and vegetables should “probably“ be distributed more equally, maybe you of all people could just say that they “should“ be distributed more equally. Yes, many people who are economically disadvantaged have made poor decisions that have led them to that spot. That said, the system makes those decisions 1 million times more likely to be chosen. The best thing you said in the video, besides the recipe itself,was that you believe many people aren’t being paid what they’re worth.

You can be really stupid (and even orange in colour) and still make money from the money you already have. That’s why rich people spend billions on lying to you to tell you that, “if only you work hard enough, you could be as rich as them”. We all know that’s bullshit. You need to start with a lot of money (or to get very lucky) to make a huge amount of money. Mostly you can be brainy, skilled, hard working, healthy, articulate and physically strong and still work your butt off and still not get rich. In the mean time, people with less advantages than you really suffer. In the mean time, lazy, stupid, greedy narcissistic, rich people will lie to you about how difficult it is for them, if they pay the same proportion of their income in taxes as you do.

{"cid": "Ugy-G7XWfUEt1geYj354AaABAg", "text": "As far as a single pizza being less efficient. I simply adjusted my pizza recipe to suit home oven cooking. I don't need to preheat my over for an hour. \nFirst order of business, tthe pizza stone is not necessary to get good leoparding on the bottom of your pizza. (Leoparding is brown spots)\nI use an aluminum pizza pan. I also don't need to transfer the pizza onto a hot pizza stone, which can be difficult. \nSecond, oil your aluminum pan very well, I mean like soaking wet with oil. \n(I use avocado oil both in the pizza dough and on the pan because of health reasons. I have a rare incurable blood cancer (myeloproliferative neoplasm) so inflammatory oils like seed oils are out they play havoc with platelets, which I can't have those at all even as an ingredient in the food. Avocado oil has a high smoke point and taste good. Extra virgin olive oil works too, avocado oil just taste better to me.)\nI usually make my dough the night before (covered in a bowl) and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight, take it out a couple of hours before you use it. You can make pizza dough several hours before using it and let it rise on the countertop covered. Occasionally I've made pizza dough and let it rise for as little as an hour before using it, though the overnight method gives a better result. \nThird, start preheating your oven to 425F, then stretch your dough on the liberally oiled aluminum pan, add your sauce and toppings. By the time my pizza is formed and topped the oven will be heated. \nSo here's the thing about preheating your oven, not all ovens are equal, you have to play with the temperature setting through trial and error the first few times you make pizza. It took about three tries over time for me to discover that my oven gave the best result for leoparding on the bottom and a brown top at 425F. You might have a convection oven or something different, it may take a different temperature setting to get a good result on top and bottom. OR you may need to put your oven rack higher up in the oven or lower down because of the way your over heats, so play with oven rack positions too. A few degrees either way will make a big difference, you need to balance how brown the pizza gets on the bottom with topping browning. But once you find that sweet spot in your oven with the pan you like to use it's sweet sailing from there on in. \nNo preheating or pizza stone needed. \n\nP.S. Since your cooking with lower temperatures you might want to change the moisture content of your dough too.I found cooking at 425F a couple extra tablesppons makes a difference.  But do it in very small increments. BUT MOST OF ALL! Don't change a lot of parameters all at once because then you don't know which tweak in your recipe was the one that got it closer to the result you want.

{"cid": "UgzG-AZ4t8rfG7o5p6h4AaABAg", "text": "Cooking does not guarantee you spend less money but it 100% goes much further if you put in the time to learn some basic stables.  Being able to create a good rice dish, pasta dish, salad, soup, sandwich, etc. is a good thing because these are all pretty modular dishes that can take in whatever you have and put out something servicable.\n\nIf you are smart about it, you can stock on staples that last you a long time. I spend around 200$ at costco every month to 2 months. I also go to the grocery store each week for smaller items. That may seem like a lot but the way I see it is that food is important to me (beyond just living) and I don't eat out at all plus I'm a young tall guy who is working out and has a bottomless stomach. \n\nCooking has definitely saved me money, on a budget. Pasta, chicken breast, cheese, a veggie, a negligable cost of seasonings. You can produce a dish that is not only as good as something you'd get at a restaurant but also make 4 servings of this for under 20$. That's better than a 5$ footlong. A 7.5$ chicken can feed a family of four for a night and maybe even have some left overs for the next day. That's better than a KFC bucket deal. A bag of potatoes is a bag of fries and mash potatoes (as well as: potatoes!) and a bag of onions is flavor for a month. \n\nIt's incredibly strange to me seeing people saying \"eating cheap is just eating the same four things over and over again.\" Eating cheap is just recognizing that you have to spend money to save money. i buy pasta at costco to cover the next 2-3 months of pasta eating. I buy big bags of rice to make rice. I eat eggs with rice. I eat eggs with bread if I find a good loaf for a few bucks at a grocery store. I make my own biscuits and if I find sausage discounted i make white gravy with it. I would say I never spend more than 5 days eating the same thing (becuase i typically meal prep 5 days out.) and each week on the weekends I am allowed to be creative and ask what I want to eat or try to make for the week ahead. \n\nI eat better and cheaper than nearly everyone I know. I understand that there are some housing/work situations that make this not possible, but for me I am making awesome stuff for myself each week at a fraction of the price of even other people who don't efficiently purchase things for themselves (and I enjoy cooking so it's fun for me too).", "time": "5 giorni fa", "author": "@partyxday", "channel": "UCbGEr-dbyOelLKje_0Txg0w", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kACRTqsRIVOBKDhtutFJ62Kc1vOoeaOY0JMu0Ae1NUx-tl=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741776630.440151}

{"cid": "UgzaOBQsN45DyMc0Z0t4AaABAg", "text": "I did grocery reviews for about a year. Every store in my city, every week.  I personally saved people millions in research time, and thousands at the register. There's no denying it: it is absolutely worth it to cook at home, versus take-out or sit-down diners (let alone any high class joint). \n\nThe biggest take-aways were:\n- Not every sale is created equally. Learn the price of things and stop overpaying. Dodge those faux-sales where items are priced high and reduced to an otherwise-regular price.\n- Patience is a virtue. If it's not on sale, avoid buying it if you can. When the price is good, stock up, especially for pantry goods, anything you can freeze (get a chest freezer), toiletries - basically anything that doesn't spoil.\n- Cook according to what's on sale. If it wasn't on sale, you're not eating it. Period. This translates into savings, sure, but also increased variety and creative cooking. Over time, the creative aspect gets easier and less time/energy intensive.\n- Build up a good pantry of staples (rice, grains, beans, flour). Fill that chest freezer with sale meat, bread, and butter. Build a good selection of herbs, spices, and seasonings (buy in bulk when you can, don't buy the stupid 5x priced little jars).\n- Get at least one good-ish knife and upgrade your knife skills. Not a Japanese folded steel $500 thing. Just a $100 chef's knife you can learn to sharpen yourself. Heck, even a shit knife sharpened with the base of a ceramic coffee cup will do wonders. The time-savings from knowing how to use a knife properly are worth the practice.\n- Planning ahead pays off (thawing out ingredients, planning your grocery shopping around the days before and after new sales roll over into a new week)\n- When possible, grow a small garden for ingredients that are high-margin/high-waste/high-convenience items, mainly fresh herbs, a few hot pepper varieties (mild to proper hot), a few tomato plants (I suggest smaller, high-producing heirloom varieties that pack more flavour than big watery tomatoes that take forever to ripen).\n- When it comes to cooking, your time is worth exactly the difference between the cost of ingredients and the cost you'd pay to have someone make it for you.\n\nThat last point is SUPER important. If it costs $10-15 and 1 hour to make a pizza, versus 40 bucks to have one of equal quality delivered to you in the same hour, then you're effectively paying yourself $25-30 an hour to make that damned pizza. For many people and households, this is a non-trivial value opportunity. Many people have to work 2 extra hours at a min-wage/mediocre paying job to make up that extra $25-30 they might get AFTER tax. So, just do the work yourself. Sure, at first, it could take longer than an hour, but you get quick at it, and soon making your own pizza (in the comfort of your own home) becomes an hour spent at a stove to save two at a shitty job. And this applies across the board, for hundreds of meals a year, most of which require much less than an hour to prepare. So, unless you're making over $30/h (after tax), it's worth it to cook for yourself. Once you get the ball rolling, the savings compound rather quickly, and the savings roll through the year as you buy and replenish your pantry/freezer stocks based on sales. \n\nAnd goodness... dry beans. They cost 1/4 as much as canned, or, for the $3 you spend on a bag of beans, you get $12 worth of beans for just soaking them yourself.", "time": "5 giorni fa (modificato)", "author": "@PentodeSensations", "channel": "UCxipXurevNGhekSvrKwRbQg", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kl5RAjgzcECtu_ZTOaUYCP_vwrQg9no4d6puU71KE=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741776631.866949}

It can cost around 1€/Kg sometime even less.It's also really cool because you can do so much different thing with potatoes (if you use the right kind), french fries, mashed potatoes, pomme dauphine, sautée potatoes,  etc... For vegetables, Yellow onions are a good contester, 1.5€/Kg depending of what time of year you buy it. Because yeah, that one of the main point of buying on a budget: you need to buy what is available in the season, it's generaly cheaper. Also i don't know how it work in the US but you can get food who are close to the limit date for cheaper  (you obviously have to it cook when you return home for safety reason). They are sometime 25 to 33% cheaper and it make a huge difference. Also i recommand to use seasoning and create a sauce with your food\n\nAnd finaly, don't look at the price but the price per kg. Sometime food cost more but you save money because you have more quantity for less money. Also freezer can help to keep food longer if you buy too much but i sometime freeze them in little portion to be in use them when i defreeze them. For exemple 3 months ago, i buy 1kg of beef because it was in sale and i froze it after only using 100g asap but forgot to cut it in small part. So now i've to use the whole 900g if i defroze it, it kinda suck but teach me a lesson.\n\nPS: the video is on point and he know what he is doing, i appreciate that.", "time": "5 giorni fa", "author": "@Eldiran1", "channel": "UCbzhepX78IaXnMmOnMg9JQQ", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_n5N25E7hC3AWegNWNjSYxpTcG8ODaVU7c9zToGshuQMw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741776631.900155}

If you choose not to do that, chances are you will stay where you're at.  If you get richer then screw it up, you can end up poor again.  My own life is a prime example of this.  Sometimes you can get in between.  You can also choose WHERE you live--Texas or Oklahoma is a lot cheaper than California or New York.\n\nOn eating out versus eating cheaper at home:  I can spend $50 to maybe $75 a week and eat homemade meals with meat of some sort in every meal.  But if I'm eating fast food all the time--buying $14 meals for every meal, that's almost $300/week.  But--I can't do fancy cuts of steak on that sorta budget.  If you wanna make it interesting, fill your pantry with a large variety of spices.  Spices are expensive other than salt (and buy the store brand salt--sodium chloride is sodium chloride and likewise for iodized), but two things on that:  first, once you buy a jar, you'll probably have that jar for awhile unless you use that particular spice a lot.  Second, I don't know if any other stores do this, but if you shop at WinCo, you can buy spices in their bulk section--no, I don't mean buying a 5lb bag of garlic powder or something.  You grab a bag, dispense said garlic powder into it to your desired amt, and buy it by weight.  It tends to be cheaper than prepackaged jars.  And then they sell you plastic jars you can put it in.

{"cid": "UgxvuRPlnxcu9H325Bh4AaABAg", "text": "What people in Cooking YouTube that show \"cookery on a budget\" often overlook is 1) whether you start a recipe from scratch with all ingredients purchased; 2) whether each ingredient is a one-time use (full volume) or has multiple doles (many volumes); 3 whether a \"staple\" of a kitchen is included in a recipe (e.g., flour, sugar, eggs, milk). When a \"meal\" costs $3.00 per serving, for example, is that a dish that you make one time for one exact serving or for four servings at one meal or makes several servings over multiple meals, and is there \"waste\" that either you can't use in anything else or is it \"thrift\" because you can use parts of ingredients in something else over time?\n\nMany, many, many videos gloss over this. The meal you made has both a) \"staple\" items, such as beans, spices, sugar, even the vinegar; b) fresh items that you may or may not keep, such as the capsicum/bell pepper or onion, which means you might have i) waste which can't be reused (and I see almost none); ii) thrift, such as the vinegar, spices, and if you use DRIED beans [which you did], extra beans; iii) excess, which can be stored in a 15K fridge (and simmered Cuban-style black beans -- CONGRÍ -- is a \"freezes beautifully\" food that lasts for weeks in the freezer).\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this video and hope people who watched had takeaways that got them to think/plan/imagine in how to be economical in buying and making cooked food at home.", "time": "6 giorni fa (modificato)", "author": "@peabody1976", "channel": "UCwSdHQcqDMbT4vbz9mz9O_A", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_n-DJjJaRZgYLiE_s4KW4IIgQfixb036Q70fDmOEI-w0IUN=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741690235.296894}

I’m gonna give this like a 60% untrue. The reason for that is cause farmers aren’t dumb. Why would you feed live stock a product you could be selling. And the answer is they don’t, most live stock food is subhuman standards. Foods that couldn’t be sold to humans, usually bye products of farming like corn stalks for example. There is also class 2 vegetables, ones that are misshapen or for some other reason can’t be sold in a store. Live stock have much stronger digestive systems, and lower culinary standards, so they eat the food we won’t. There is still parts of animal feed that humans could reasonably eat but it’s not like animals feed is primarily made of food that could just as easily been sold in the grocery. \n\nIf you want a better explanation of this go to the channel What I’ve Learned.

Hell, the more middlemen you skip, the cheaper you can go. For example buying whole chicken and processing it yourself is so much cheaper than buying just a package of pre-cut breasts or thighs... You get bones you can turn into a great soup (that's like 8-10 portitions easily for a bigger chicken and enough veggies), you can render the fat and store it so you need to buy less oil/fats since you can produce your own, and you obviously get 2 thighs, 2 breasts and 2 wings... what I do is I usually use the breasts for some actual recipes, like king pao, or chicken salad or whatever, that's another 4-6 portions of food there, and I freeze and collect the thighs for other recipes. There's plenty of similar tricks... Like don't peel your potatoes or if you do need to, keep the peels and prepare them in a different ways.... Don't throw vegetable cuttings away, keep them for stocks... Use deep frozen vegetables and fruits more, those are good quality and cheap, certain vegetables like spring onions can be stored in water on the window rather than in fridge, which means it will continue growing and yield more onion... There's plenty of zero-waste tricks you can use to make all your meals cheaper and healthier... The quality of the meal itself is mostly a skill thing... keep cooking for long enough and you'll find plenty of ways and techniques to turn the same amount of ingredients into higher quality and better tasting results... ofc there are exceptions, I'm not gonna make foie gras a lot, or fry my pommes in duck fat... I'm not going to eat a beef wellington often or anything like that... but to be fair when you go to a restaurant, how often do you really order a meal that you couldn't make at home?

It had all these weird modular attachments (rotisserie, electric grill, etc) and I just hated it.  Took forever to heat up, the oven space was tiny and eventually I just said \"This stove is over 40 years old, it's time to replace it.\"\n\nExcept down-draft systems aren't really that common anymore.

{"cid": "Ugw4xFM1kZuowJanE8R4AaABAg", "text": "You don't have to eat the same thing every night on a low budget. Your variety is restricted by how much you can acquire within the scope of your budget before things go bad, but within that you can mix and match. The colored bell peppers are $3 for a three pack at my local Aldi. Learn how to store vegetables correctly (for most things this involves supplying moisture, e.g. a damp paper towel wrapped around the stem). For my money, a minimalistic side salad or a bit of fruit goes much further in making me feel I've had fresh food than aromatics that melt into the dish and are easily substituted from the spice cupboard.\n\nKroger is not as bad as some other regional brands, but generally speaking, the mainstream full-service grocery store is usually one of the most expensive options.  In addition to Aldi and Walmart, some regions have programs where SNAP recipients can increase their buying power at farmers' markets (you can buy a token worth $5 for $3 in SNAP or something like that), as well as food bank mass produce distributions which may have more generous income limits than the food pantries do. Speaking of SNAP I imagine many of your audience are singles with what not too long ago would have been considered perfectly decent early-career incomes, now straining under inflated rents, so their total incomes may be too high to qualify - but everyone should double-check this regardless, because you might be surprised. The formula they use to determine eligibility is complex, and ends up encompassing more people than those of us who grew up middle-class and unfamiliar with assistance programs might assume.  \n\nStop using \"poor\" to mean middle class and \"rich\" to mean \"upper middle class\" like some clueless suburban teenager - refrigerator notwithstanding, I don't think you actually qualify as rich (resale value is a cruel mistress!) and I seriously doubt you were ever actually poor. That said, I totally appreciate you taking this on. There's a lot of frugal cooking channels on YT but they tend to be very \"standard American diet\" oriented, with offerings that look like a counsel of despair to us downwardly mobile types who were raised to care what we eat. The number of people who are culturally middle class, but economically poor or near-poor, is exploding.

Go and look at the video by What I've Learned titled \"Eating less Meat won't save the Planet. Here's Why\", it is a great breakdown by an actual expert in the field. The idea that meat is bad for the environment is propagated by people like Netflix and started way back in the 60s or 70s. The fact is that many of your proteins in legumes and the like cannot be absorbed by your body the same way as from meat. We are made to be omnivorous, our bodies are geared that way, that's why we don't have extra stomachs like a cow. Eating meat is an incredibly effective way to get both proteins and many vitamins. \nAdditionally, most grazing that cattle and sheep use is not arable land, so you're not taking away land that could be farmed for something else. In my country, the best sheep and lamb meat comes from an area that is semi desert, where you couldn't grow other crops due to water scarcity, but the sheep have no issues eating the local scrub, with the bonus of making the meat taste amazing. Same goes for cattle, they can graze in rocky areas, or on slopes too steep to farm, making productive land out of otherwise un-farmable land.\nDon't lose sleep over encouraging meat consumption.\nEven better, encourage cooking of cheaper meat cuts to get the benefits of having meat in your diet.\n\nOtherwise, thanks for the straightforward video and generally sparking my love for cooking with your channel over the past 5 years.

{"cid": "UgyWMs-oM7GFMM-kMJJ4AaABAg", "text": "Yeah, restaurants do tend to make more food as they have a much larger number of people that they need to feed in a given day.  Making meals for one person can be a bit tricky to make economical, but keep in mind that you can cook a bit more and then reuse stuff for other meals.  If you use a quarter of an onion to add to a hamburger for lunch, you aren't going to throw out the rest of that onion.  But you will definitely want to try to meal plan or meal prep to try to make it easy to know what your next meal will be and to make sure that you go through the ingredients that you have.  In addition, you want to get a permanent marker which you can write and track the purchase dates of some of your ingredients to make sure that you are minimizing food waste.  Some bits of vegetable trimmings, toss into a bag in the freezer and when you have enough, you can toss them all into a crock pot with a bunch of water to make your own veggie stock.  My girlfriend would also buy a rotisserie chicken for one meal.  Leftover chicken meat would be then used for something like tacos.  I know that she had like 4 or so different ways to reuse the same chicken into the next meal.\nI also know that you touched on this too, but yeah, eating a whole food plant based diet does tend to be cheaper.  We did do this for a while, but if you lead a pretty busy lifestyle, you might not have the time to make something using whole foods and might end up eating something more pre-packaged, as it tends to be quicker and more convenient than making all of your own stuff from whole foods.  By whole foods, I do mean using as many things you buy that do not come in a box with a list of ingredients.\nAlso keep in mind that the more something is processed, the more it tends to cost to buy.  If you go to the produce department of an American supermarket, look at how much they charge to buy a package of sliced watermelon versus how much it costs to buy the whole watermelon yourself.  It costs way more to buy the stuff pre-sliced and then packaged than if you buy a watermelon and slice it at home.", "time": "8 giorni fa", "author": "@FFVison", "channel": "UCYBd42VB1V5ZS4xrpVkughg", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m9tlx-c4yozd4re_qyhMb5FTeva_EvBUof-KmrXks=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741517448.872166}

I’ve done hundreds of job applications and had dozens of interviews and I’m never quite the person they are looking for. It’s incredibly frustrating, and the rejection is horrible. It’s also drained my savings completely. One bright spot is that I found a mutual aid group in my neighbourhood that runs a food co-op. Every week I can pay £1 for a week’s worth of groceries, which is mainly just expiring food from local restaurants and grocery stores. It’s so much better than the food bank, where I am limited to one trip every two weeks, which is hard when what they give you is very meagre. The co-op was set up during the pandemic and it’s a finely tuned machine these days.

This feels glaringly inaccurate to be told such a thing. You work harder, and you end up losing more money than you earn, simply because you put in more effort at no extra benefit or income. Working smarter either involves a lot of time and/or money invested, and the only more \"viable\" way to work smarter in America is nepotism. That's the biggest problem behind America's economy and its job markets. And yes, I get it, it's a pessimistic take, but that's a lot about what America *is*.\n\nAnd let's not pretend that America's notoriously car-centric infrastructure doesn't exist, which basically means you have to be earning more money to maintain your car, even if you are regular at keeping it in shape. And in some states, jobs aren't always within reach, even for driving.\n\nI also get that buying in bulk is very expensive in the long run, because food waste is insanely detrimental, but a $14 salad bowl feels like it's a weird thing to have: the pricing of food, itself, is already inflated as it is, and so is eating out, like how eating out always has been.", "time": "8 giorni fa", "author": "@daviddebroux4708", "channel": "UCWITyAP-zCVOjnvYJR5YOmQ", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mZutWDlgW8i88EUCh6C-wha7OqObhEdCEkOZQMqcrS9rOw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741517456.21101}

In a Capitalist system, those standing at the top sabotaging the ladder are the Oligarchs, the ones with, well Capital. That’s all well and good, we know that already, assuredly.\n\nThe problem is, switching from Capitalism to another system, let’s say Communism like the old Union, is not getting rid of the ladder, it’s painting the ladder a pretty shade of red and calling that progress. And instead of the Oligarchs with Capital at the top sabotaging the ladder, it’s now instead the Vanguard Party with Political Power whom are sabotaging the ladder. \n\nI mean, we have well documented proof of this, from the secret wars of the Presidium, to the bickering between the Soviets and Chinese, to the fact that the majority of people whom had to live under Communism in Eastern Europe really don’t want it back? \n\nOr, casting your eyes further East, you can see how Communism can be used as a disguise for a system somehow combining both the worst traits of Capitalism and Communism in the modern CCP, where the guys standing atop the ladder are both the Vanguard Party whom have Political Power and Oligarchs with Capital, the only difference is that the Vanguard are also the Oligarchs at the same time, and they have a lot more guns than the American Oligarchs. \n\nHell, even my home country of Vietnam suffers from the same thing, we pay lip service to the ideals of Socialism, but frankly? Americans have more social security and support networks than us. And yes, I know how bad things are over there, so that should probably put into perspective just how terrible things are over here, or in China. Add onto that the fact that we inherited both the shadiness of old Imperial China as well as the Russian vranyo traditions and you have a “boat” that looks a hell of a lot more like a boardwalk. \n\nHell, I can even point you back to a time in Vietnam’s history, what we call Thời Bao Cấp, where true, completely equal socialism was tried... and it proved to be a time almost as disastrous as the famine of 1945-46. That’s what happens when you try to build the boat — crafty, ambitious, unscrupulous people will start poking holes in it so other people sink down, pushing them up. \n\nTo the “some of us” who are trying to solve the problem this way, I don’t blame you. It’s incredibly noble what you’re trying to do, but the problem is our species, and our reality as a whole, is an ugly one. Equity, egalitarianism, equality are beautiful things, and so they are nearly impossible to have, and certainly impossible to maintain. \n\nA far more feasible solution, at least from what I know, would be a system similar to Western Europe or the Nordic countries. They have their fair share of problems, yes, but they seem to be closer to cracking the code than anyone else. They are certainly further along than the Soviets ever were, and probably closer to proper Socialism than we or the Chinese will ever get.", "time": "1 giorno fa", "author": "@NosFurRatTou", "channel": "UCJJdnAShPVkYJQ6Rq209jwQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mvRD3li-d41yRn_E5Os_4vOsBVZjneUdJDuG7vaq5mQf2ukH8_J5e7d4ICjs5ajyz-7g=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1742122256.738308}

But also, making more money doesn’t necessarily correlate with working harder or being more innovative. Sometimes it correlates with being as unoriginal as possible, or making other people work harder for less while you profit. One of the number one criticisms of a system like communism would be that people are often forced to work under duress. But in the same breath people will say what makes capitalism so great is that you need to work hard to have a good life (or in an extreme case like America, any life at all).

I think the world has flip-flopped and kitchens are actually now a luxury, whereas eating out is the cheap option for those who lack time/money. We're not fully there yet but I could see housing with community kitchens or no kitchens catching on and reasonably healthy/cheap options like Factor becoming the new standard \"staple\" for lower classes. There was a company called Maple in NYC a while back. It was basically a local meal prep kitchen set up wherever real estate was cheapest and then they had couriers that delivered the meals. They did it all in house. No DoorDash and no cloud kitchens. Guess it didn't work out but I love the idea of delivery-included low-cost healthy meals.

Stay out of economics, politics, morality as long as you are primarily a cooking channel; it's not a good look and takes you far, far out of your wheelhouse.  (Occasionally disagreeing with you in one context, that you're actually somewhat knowledgeable in, is all my wife and I can take and maintain a friendly regard that makes us watch your channel; adding many other vectors of disagreement, especially in areas that did not make you beloved or famous or successful, is a compounding disaster.)\n2.  Eating frugally isn't some great sacrifice, don't tell people to feel bad about being motivated to learn what's healthy and develop skills that will make them and their loved ones perfectly healthy for +100x times less money.\n3.  In your refrigerator example, the choice that makes you seem crazy isn't the expensive refrigerator (most poor people can imagine spending a lot of money if they have it to spare), it's the fact that you couldn't even imagine (in your discourse about your experience) having a refrigerator that didn't like up basically flush with the area provided for it, to the point where the choice was to replace it with a very expensive refrigerator or to remodel your cabinetry.\n4.  You are out of touch, you're just dealing with it in the entirely wrong way.\n\nThat said, I understand that you're just a guy.  I hope you keep doing all right and keep forging your own successful path in your life, I'd just selfishly like to see your parasocial business continue to flourish in the context that I first encountered you.

I've learned to cook my whole life and come up with OR reference recipes that work in under 20 min and with little to no crazy expense. Meat can be a real budget killer unless it's ground, I've seen, so I usually just get that when I'm eating out. It's possible, but it takes a lot more work, and some people who need to work more hours (for less pay, probably) just do not have the energy and time, to no fault of their own.

Meat prices in this country are affected by the fact that the animal is a secondary product, but we also have a massive amount of monopolization that has driven the prices up in the past couple of decades way beyond where they should be (and put many farmers out of business). It's also worth noting that there are vast tracts of land in the US that are non-arable, but perfectly fine for livestock. \n\nOn the environmental front, we need to continue to promote rotational grazing (and high-density rotational grazing) as a better alternative to the factory farming. This has the added benefit of revitalizing the land the livestock are on. Even better if we can rotate through multiple groups of animals that are complementary. This is not a new notion in farming, but a lot of people tend to laugh it off or disregard it, basically saying that cow emissions are killing the planet or some such garbage. We had millions of bison on this continent and the world didn't end before, having a fractional population of cows isn't the threat people think it is (before we even get into the carbon cycle). Fertilizer runoff is just as bad as any animal product, so what we need are better farming methods that make sense for the land, not less animals.\n\nIt's about balance.", "time": "9 giorni fa", "author": "@Pandrogas", "channel": "UC6K3fJG61jU8Cl5Xxp6RcJw", "votes": "0", "replies": "4", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_l1XiJ_l3PT88o-LvY8WlFOgzUiQaptnC42xIXDMo8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741431071.456972}

Poor people are often exhausted by either working long hours or simply the crap experience they have to deal with day to day. Simplifying eating affordably by buying back some of their time in the form of the veg already being prepped and frozen, can help cut out the cost associated with vegetables going bad if you don't readily prep them and you get time back associated with the prep. So you are much more likely to use all of what you bought. Also you can bulk buy alot of frozen veg(brocoolli is excelent for making quick soups), or buy it pre-prepped (diced frozen onion and peppers encourage cooking meals).", "time": "6 giorni fa", "author": "@adammiller9029", "channel": "UCSHj63n_kpZk9LWtuZ2oI3w", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nzf_38osY0eh7aPQbfKu6wRof-DTAs7pSaNm9ZMqGPUJFfWyS5SFzzSHFBOz2qGsV8gw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741690275.706889}

{"cid": "Ugy1dcKNYoa0lfmX-Hl4AaABAg", "text": "I will disagree in the vinegar. You most definitely can taste the difference between something like balsamic, apple or distilled vinegar, even in a cooked dish. \n\nThat's part of the reason why you add it near the end (depends on what you're doing).\n\nAnyways, another good way to keep some variety in your cooking without ballooning your costs is meal prep and proper storage. A bunch of veggies and fruit will last for quite a while (weeks or even months) if you store them correctly. There's lots of information online about it, so look up your most commonly used stuff.\n\nMeal prep would be getting your tupperware and jars out and turning some of your bulk ingredients into meal-ready components. Some can go in your fridge while others can go in your freezer and then for when you want to cook, you just mix and match what you feel like at the moment. \n\nThat being said, it's best to do so with a shopping list/ingredient plan. Something like \"for this week I have a bell pepper, two onions, a zucchini, some champignons, three carrots, a bit of ginger, a clove of garlic, a bag of mixed nuts\" etc. And no matter what you make during the week, at the end of the week the goal is to have it all be gone and not have to throw anything away.\n\nYou can easily supplement that with your pantry stuff and spices.\n\nThat way you're flexible in your cooking and your choice of carb and protein, but you have a base set of veggies and fruit you can use for a variety of dishes instead of eating the same thing over and over.", "time": "9 giorni fa", "author": "@Salted_Fysh", "channel": "UCH4wFgD3c5z304m3f_QZmpQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mhpdt52gf-ewuMICMSpf58jqqKXetktX-rAgmJkXZktJrVu4vDkBYngfAtIfmb6uJy3w=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741431078.292492}

And that is you have 11 years experience, hard to fill position, get full bonus, and have either a doctorate or master's +75 credit hours That is a huge cost and time commitment). Sounds like a decent amount but median home is about 560k and a typical bachelor's degree at the local state school is about 120-125k if you live on campus. But I am sure some states that invest more in education do pay better relative to pay.

She was making about 27k 20 years ago. Adjusted for 67% inflation since then that is just over 45k in today's dollars. For a job that requires a bachelor's degree (and heavy pressure to get a master's within the first 3-5 years).\n\nI realize not all states are this bad. But far too many are. I think teachers are mostly used as an example for low pay based on how the worst states treat them. How low the pay is relative to cost of living, how little their pay goes up despite large investments in their education compared to other jobs, how much invisible work they do (beyond the 7 hours, 180 days per year people see), how much stress they get about testing scores or the difficulty of classroom management with kids that struggle to behave during the day. I doubt people are talking about New York or Connecticut teachers when using them an example of low pay. But Florida, Alabama, and Arizona? Definitely.\n\nAnd I totally get there are plenty of jobs that are underpaid. Heck, I have an issue any job that is full time work that cannot pay a living wage in the local economy.

{"cid": "UgzRyUP-oc0LNW0Ftgh4AaABAg", "text": "I recently had to start being much more mindful about how much I'm spending on groceries, due to personal (and thankfully temporary) circumstances. Basically just wanting to create a bit of a safety net for myself in terms of savings. You start to realise just how indulgent we can be with food, without even realising it. I've actually enjoyed going back to basics and using cheap, staple ingredients, making them taste amazing for a small amount of money. It's surprising just how cheaply you can feed yourself, if you're willing to do the research and find good recipes. Buying and cooking in bulk, and freezing leftover portions, has also been a game-changer. Most weeks I can have a couple night's worth of meals for \"free\" because they're already in my freezer waiting. Also, having smaller portions for dinner, and stretching a 2-portion recipe to 3 nights, and making up the calories with a larger breakfast and lunch is also good, because it tends to be cheaper to have a larger breakfast or lunch. Buy reduced items that are about to go out of date and freeze them. We have an app here in the UK called Olio that allows people to give away free food (usually it's people who work at a supermarket and bring home the food that has just gone out of date.) I appreciate not everybody can put in this level of effort if they have a had job, or medical issues.

First of all, there absolutely are pockets of America that are about as bad as a lot of what we call third-world countries, so “Americans” paints with too broad of a brush. Secondly, while the American poor have way higher access to a lot of cheap consumer goods and at least some interface with a modern healthcare system via Medicaid, that has also come at the expense of a lot of what people feel makes life worth living: strong communities, a sense of purpose, etc. Alienation is very bad pretty much across the board right now, and that can make an “ashes in the mouth” of a lot of what should be objective advancements in quality of life. My wife is from a much poorer and more unstable country, and while she appreciates the material abundance, she can’t help but notice how bloodless most Americans really are. Even upper middle-class families are vulnerable to the opioid epidemic, for example, and amongst the poor, it’s killing something like 100k a year. Basic costs of living are up across the board, such that basic milestones like having a stable place to live or having kids are increasingly unattainable. Something like 1/8 of blue collar men have no romantic attachments, few friends, no kids, etc. It’s bleak. I think if you listed what a poorer person in America can have to a poor person 80+ years ago, it would sound amazing, but only if you don’t tell them that it would come at the expense of much/most of what makes their lives feel like they’re worth living.", "time": "9 giorni fa", "author": "@keithjackewicz8423", "channel": "UCv-Rgic3j-YlpifLyyZfxpQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kFISXZqOSNaS2PWYKtguJq4ZU9qlJcf_yKTS0VONgLEQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741431085.585282}

In case you're not in the US, a good fridge costs easily $3,000. A basic fridge is $1,500, and a cheap fridge is $1,000. These fridges last anywhere from 3 years if you're unlucky to 10 years if you're lucky, 15 if you're very lucky. A sub zero fridge cost $15,000 but comes with a 20 year warranty from sub zero and if you do cooking for your likelihood having some of the features of the fridge might be worth it. So if you have to replace a fridge twice within 20 years if you're lucky, and each fridge is going to cost $3,000 then your already half the cost of the much better fridge.

{"cid": "UgwerQPYKkKMPWfu9pB4AaABAg", "text": "This video takes budget cooking to an extreme (which is needed sadly!), but it's not hard to make nice meals budget friendly as well, which I think sometimes people forget.  In general going out to eat these days (or door-dash or whatnot) is just exorbitant costing, and you will almost always save money if you just make food at home and (key here!) eat the leftovers and don't throw food away.  Plan ahead and eat multiple meals off one prep and you'll almost always save money in comparison to going out or ordering uber eats.\n\nExample for a meal recently made at my house.  Made a pot roast a week ago with a nice ($$) chuck roast.  Paid almost $20 for meat alone!  But potatoes/carrots/onions cost was low enough (maybe an extra $5).  Add in a few more dollars for the onion powder/dried parsley/soup mix I used and we're talking say $27 total (probably less, but will use $27 for convenience).  My wife and I had a great first meal off that, including seconds.  We had another great leftovers meal 4 days later.  And I'm about to finish off the leftovers today for breakfast, making a nice hash out of the remaining beef/potatoes/carrots/onions.  So if we say that total cost was $27, 3 meals was $9/ea, divide by 2 for me and the wife and we come out to $4.50/meal.  Not saying that's super cheap, but for a really nice meal?  Delicious, nutritious, far better and cheaper than ordering out.  And I think that's what some people forget - you can save money and still eat delicious meals if you just are conscientious about what you buy and eat the leftovers and don't throw them out.\n\nOne more tip?  People always (even Adam here!) talk about eating the same meal for 3-4 meals in a row.  You don't need to do that.  I hate eating the same thing two days in a row.  Most meals will last as leftovers 5-7 days in the fridge.  Make a nice meal, eat it again 2 days later.  Then 2 days after that!  And lots of meals are freezer-worthy.  Toss leftovers in freezer, pull them out in 3 weeks for a delicious, no-work meal.  Learn how to save your food and eat all your leftovers.  Cook food that you know you'll want to eat the leftovers!  Use economies of scale to make a lot of food that you can then save and eat later.  We all have different foods we like to eat.  Figure out some of your favourite meals and then plan how you can make a big pot/pan/mess of it and how you can save it for future meals.\n\nDoing all this?  In the long run, you'll save a ton on both groceries and going out.  Going out is what kills the budget, and if you can avoid going out or ordering in more than once a week?  You'll be doing far better than otherwise.", "time": "9 giorni fa", "author": "@JamanMosil", "channel": "UC4mStPLhG-eIwDHYmIRGBHA", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/whgBcREnphjFKLxDSnegqpNSHZWVZS_BAebHL9Pgx9buU0jEaypIuDKJY7I8fUeuj4FZIzqsex8=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741431087.398665}

The raw/authentic feeling your videos just radiate is quite hard to come by because most of the people doing similar style of videos just don’t feel the need for them to do something else than teach people how to cook a certain thing in a certain way. Don’t be sorry about the \"bad\" influence you might have had. Noone would initially be able to think that far forward while just creating cooking videos for fun.  Keep doing whatever you enjoy in whatever way you prefer. The audience will either naturally grow with it or you will attract a new different one.

As much as many folks rail against capitalism, looking around at some of the alternatives has been disheartening to say the least. At the same time, that does not excuse the past or present state of things in the United States, because things could definitely be better, and just pointing out that they could be worse is beside the point. Also, the whole luxury doesn't mean better/ more useful. That is so incredibly true! Honestly, the single biggest thing that I'm grateful for out of a fancy new fridge is having the ice and water dispenser, that way there's no separate thing that I need for filtering. And ice on demand is amazing, having grown up without it. I truly appreciate it. Now. I also love the trick you do here with showing how to make this one meal pretty darn fancy, while also advocating for the cheap like your shocking secret to vegetable soup. Also, while many folks do not have access to gardening, far too many of us are wasting huge tracts of land to lawn space rather than a decent garden, and it's that time of year!

In the context of Economics - which is avowedly Liberal - the name of Marx is akin to Voldemort's. You are not allowed to speak of him, period.\nAnd you cannot critique something you haven't read. It's like me saying that you're wrong, without ever reading your opinion. That's science (and logic) denial. \n\nMarx was nothing more nothing less than a Classic Economist, like many other Classic Economists of his time, whom he studied.\n\ni.e: Aristostle was incredibly wrong about a lot of stuff. And yet, Philosophy courses don't treat him like Voldemort. In fact, Aristotle is taught within philosophy, without any problems or regrets... because Philosophy, unlike Economics, actually asks their students to engage with the historical material critically, to dissect it, and to separate the wheat from the chaff. \nFor the most part, Economics is literally just an ideological indoctrination program - one that does not have very good predictive capabilities, since \"value is subjective lol, and it's impossible to calculate the entire economy lol, so I guess we'll just throw our hands in the air and give up lol\". They're like \"\"scientists\"\" trying to discover the structure of the galaxy without having a telescope. It's impossible to do it.\n\nEconomics is about studying (highly flawed, incomplete, non-predictive) macroeconomic models. \nThey have purposefully decoupled the study of Economics from Political Economy, which is why you will never hear a word about Marx, or any other alternative economic models to Capitalism. That's simply not part of their program. And that's by DESIGN. \nIn Economics, you're not meant to engage with the economic model critically, but to simply follow some highly complicated mathematical formulas, so you can say you're the only expert in the room whose opinions are infallible.", "time": "9 giorni fa (modificato)", "author": "@feelthebern3783", "channel": "UCFKG9Ul63Ti1d3iAqIkYVuw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lgxgzE-bxwsLxi3W72LNAz8lWRxEOVap7JrT07bBv4oA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741431096.488024}

There are a few things i'd like to add:\n\nFrozen vegetables mixes are a good alternative to fresh produce at least where i live, it probably isn't all that cheaper compared to an onion and bell pepper, but it has much more variety and convenience. Vegetables with longer shelf life like potatoes(count those as carbohydrates), carrots, cabbage and canned tomatoes are also fairly cheap.\n\nVitamin C is degraded by heat, so you lose most of it in cooked vegetables. Rather squeeze some lemon juice in your water at every meal, or eat the vegetables raw (I can't do it with onions but bell peppers are delicious).\n\nMost beans and legumes can contain different levels of toxins or anti-nutrients, which inhibit your absorption of vitamines and minerals you eat in the same meal. The reason we soak (and cook) them is to remove those substances, but if you don't discard the soaking water you're still going to ingest them. This is not a problem in a varied diet, and the extra calories and other un-inhibited nutrients might be beneficial to you, but it can lead to nutritional deficiencies if you eat beans every day. The best middle ground for me is to discard the soaking water but keep the cooking water.\n\nI'm not aware of studies that have contradicted these last two points, but if there are any, I would like to know about them.", "time": "10 giorni fa (modificato)", "author": "@TheCecchino98", "channel": "UCJ46HSXsmZ9nzaVaICa_2PQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mgKyYgcU4SFDm8ZV2vvNXbPDF2-bN1rTm6TVcscsDilA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344699.585807}

If we we gave everyone at least equal opportunity, and if we had enough capacity to support the failures of this system, it would be great. Problem is, not every child born is an Einstein or a Mozart and not everyone has the right mindset (which comes from upbringing and situation as much as anything else) or capacity to be a creative or entrepreneur - or even wants to be. In fact, if we all were, the very system you propose would collapse because everyone would be cranking out bespoke works and the cost would be insane.\nIn reality, the people you describe tend to start with an advantage of some sort - wealthy or at least middle class parents, a patron of some sort (albeit more common in the past) - scholarships... but when a person is so poor that they have no choice but to work every waking moment, they don't have the bandwidth to worry about being inventive or creative - they're too busy worrying about - you know - making it to the next morning.\nSo really, if you want the maximum creative and inventive people - the most Einsteins and Mozarts - the best way isn't to run the population through a gauntlet and hope the ones who survive weren't just lucky, or overpopulate the world in the hopes that the ratios work out - it's to build a society with a good basic social infrastructure that allows people the freedom of trying to do risky things safely, and then educate them and incentivize that risk taking.\nWhich we actually do for the wealthy.\nBut in the US, the class system divides everyone into the small group of really successfuls and the rest of the people who, since they clearly aren't good enough or work hard enough, aren't worthy of good things and so should be worker-drones who eat the most basic of foods, mass produced and generally not good for them because - they don't deserve good food.\nYou guys get a lot of that from your founding economy, BTW, when some people were property of the wealthy class and used to do the work the wealthy people didn't want to do.

I had to swap out a lot of foods that most people wouldnt think twice about because of the sheer volume and consistency with which I was eating them. anyways, it worked and i no longer have debt but it was an undeniable TON of work that I frankly wouldn't have had the energy for if I worked a more physical job.

Restaurants buy mozzarella,flower, prosciutto in bulc so they buy it way cheaper then you can find it in a supermarket but everytime I'm in a Italian restaurant and I see a carbonara, cacio e pepe or a Alllio e olio pasta for 8$ it makes me laugh because I can make that plate for a fraction of the price.

For families that eat a lot I would say it's much more important, as the piddly little meals made by restaurants are rarely sufficient or satisfying, especially at their price point. When cooking for 3 or 4 the meals end up being around 10 dollars a person for really nice high quality meals with no cheap ingredients, but when cooking for one the price feels like it balloons up to 15 or even 20 dollars per meal.

{"cid": "UgwOe9pFEbg2ZyWjomh4AaABAg", "text": "Something not taken into account here. People look at more expensive items and have sticker shock at the grocery list required to get the ingredients for the meals they want. You also need to consider the fact that you most likely bought components that you didn't use all of in a meal. Cheese for example is quite expensive. But think how many meals are made out of that one block of cheese and divide the high cost across them. Same with butter.\nPeople often complain about fresh produce being expensive but aside from beans, rice and bread, vegetables are probably the cheapest thing you can buy at the store. You can buy a whole lot of them and make a ton of incredibly healthy meals.\nAlso, when you are first learning, shop around and figure out where produce is the cheapest. WINCO is our family go to. I've heard people talk about Aldi's and even Trader Joes (Trader Joe's is super expensive in my area). Peppers at our local WINCO run between .60c each to .80c each depending on season. Green usually are cheaper because, fun fact, green peppers are red peppers that were picked before they were allowed to ripen! As you learn your stores, you will learn which items to get where. For instance, I avoid getting tomatoes at WINCO. They tend to be mushy bland pink sob stories and I am willing to pay extra at Safeway to get nicer tomatoes. Avocados are another that I may or may not be willing to get there. Take control of your eating habits and track your spending. Enjoy watching the savings add up, because they will if you keep with it.\nEating out is unquestionably more expensive and usually less healthy.", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@eas2252", "channel": "UCjzAihzGAMXgX_w3zCX7RNQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kW5dVI8xbc9zaQU-wqilSjoVfq4QFdVCQLAHxwJG_hByI=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344705.921106}

Inhumane factory farming is a travesty, but so is vegan maximalism. Livestock is also an important part of agriculture because cows, aside from converting inedible plants into edible beef, also convert the plants into fertilizer. Topsoil erosion is a real thing (according to some, like Freeman Dyson, a bigger contributor to global warming than CO₂) and it doesn't help to grow more plants using more artificial fertilizer (made from fossil gas!!).\n\n14:39 - it's not that beans are deficient in some amino acids, but rather that plant proteins don't break down into peptides as easily as animal proteins.

I helped the vendors to pack, and got onions, tomatoes, peppers, celeri, melons, oranges, etc., put it in crates in a big circle where everyone around put the unsold food they got, we held hands in a big circle, sang a song, and picked what we wanted, with an abundance for everyone, with enough leftovers for others. We then hiked up the mountain to this little paradise, and invited the friends we saw along the way. We cooked, played music, sang, and ate such a filling, good meal, very similar to the one showed in this video, but with more variety of ingredients. \n\nI understand that even though I am \"homeless\", I am extremely privileged to live this way, that it's dependent on this industrial megamachine, at least for the rice, the vegetables are from local market gardeners. It is not scalable. \n\nBut FREE food COULD be a reality for EVERYONE. Urban and local permaculture and food forests delivering food to community and neighborhood kitchens where anyone is welcomed to have a meal. All ran by a mix of professionals and volunteers, the costs shared. \nIn France, I was part of an initiative called the food social security, where you contribute 150€ (or not) per month and get back 150€ of food regardless, from local producers that fit the criterias democratically decided by the consumers (permaculture,  regenerative, bio, etc.). \n\nFood is a BASIC NEED, it should be guaranteed. And of course, healthy and efficient. That means less or no meat when possible. Let meat re-become a luxury product that only the rich enough to want to exclude themselves from this basic food guarantee can afford.

I smoked that chicken today after spatchcocking it and rubbing it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  For me and my wife, that chicken is 8 portions.  I admit that the salad I made to go with pushed my dinner cost above yours, but I could have made, for example, pasta in tomato sauce, and my cost would have come in less.  I don't try too hard to coupon shop, but I do use the apps for my local stores, and when I shop, I will visit up to 3 stores to get the best prices on what I want.  Last week I bought a whole top sirloin cap roast, which was on sale for $6/lb.  I cut a couple Picanha steaks off it, and sealed and froze the rest.  I do the same thing with Tri Tip: I buy the untrimmed mega packs that have 2 whole Tri Tips, trim them up myself, cut them in half and seal and freeze.  I've weighed the trimmings, this boosts the sale cost from $4/lb. to $5/lb. (which is way better than the usual $8-9/lb. for trimmed).

{"cid": "UgygQiGhb8CpBXvvPBV4AaABAg", "text": "Don't feel so bad about the oven thing. Using an oven at 500 for half an hour will only use like 5-6 KWh at most (not accounting for oven cycling, so probably lower). And yes, that's a lot of energy to use over such a short period of time, but you use about the same amount of energy if you cook something else at a lower temperature for a longer period of time (considering pizza is generally cooked quite quickly after preheating). So, the question boils down to \"is it wasteful to cook food in your oven?\". I would say no, it's not, so long as you or someone is eating the food.\n\nFor reference, at $0.16 per KWh it would only cost you about $0.96 to use the oven for 30 minutes. That totals to about $29.00 to make a pizza every day for 30 days.\nAlso, if we do attempt to account for oven cycling, with an assumed oscillation range of 100 degrees (standard) your oven will probably be cycled off for about 1/3 of the time that you are using it. \nso if we do the math again, that's a total of $0.64 per half hour, and $19.00 per month of daily high power oven usage.\n\nYou use more than twice that by accidentally leaving your porch light on all day. \nIf you want to save energy, try turning off your water heater when you aren't using it. The oscillation range on water heaters is usually way lower and residential heaters can use up to 4KWh/hour. Even if it's only heating for 1/4th of the time that it is on, that is still using about $3.80 worth of energy per day. That about is $115.00 a month, and how often do you shower every day?\n\nSorry, that was a bit of a tangent. People talk about energy use a lot while not really understanding it, and while I know it's not entirely their fault, it does bother me when people beat themselves about using their oven to cook a damn pizza.", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@SethMayer-dy7kg", "channel": "UCB6ZKzXGIU3XYbzhruaiOpw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_naVtQgGqLR2mEJBYsUptJWeahbG_5vnBCPaDOqBcwUdRBL6bJjSCLq-kGRbS6uIBwmZQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344713.248723}

There are so many good foods to make that are also cheap and varied. Im glad something so core to the human experience is translatable regardless of economic status.\nAnd talking about poverty, in my opinion I dont think these people need to be treated like stray puppies nor victims.

{"cid": "UgxNpBTmDAJfR6RZGE14AaABAg", "text": "Mostly true. Some people do bennefit from several factors that still allow them to eat fsr cheaper at the consumer level than they can eating out. \n For instance, say you use a lot of tomato paste. You will not be able to go from seed to can making tomato paste at a lower cost yourself than can heinz, hunts or the store brand. Unless you are a Minnenonite, mormon or amish, you simply cant. And thats only because they arent allowed to buy those things in. UNLESS the primary driving force behind your value judgement is self gratification and hubris. \n Thats the only and largest deciding factor in this. \n But there are nearly ubiquitous busniess entitites within reasonable driving distance of most people that are in the top 50th socioeconomic percentile of americans that with a higher than average, but just slightly so, meal planning scheme, will allow you to with certain intellectual and psychological and mindful adjustment, will really allow you to save alot on food expenditures. Coupled with organizations like gleaners and local food pantires run by ngos and churches, food is plentiful as well as is nutrition at a very decent quality for nearly free. For instance ive lived off nori chips and 5 lb bags of hummus. Not for years. But you have to be adaptable.  And be willing to make excuses for why you have to make frequent retreats to isolated corners to bust ass privately. Hummus will turn you i to a wind tunnel capable of renting yourself to Lockheed martin or boeing. Ive lived off of wheathins and triscuits. Dont do that. It will give you a paper asshole. \nAlso dont eat the aldi ground beef assistant stroganoff variety. I spent an hour on the throne contemplating how i was gonna get to the emergency room and explain to them that i needed help taking a dump. With the help of a rubber glove i pilfered from work, i was able to get things moving with a minimum of tearing. Full disclosure i added a lot of cheese to that so that might have had some effect on the ultimate 'outcome'\n Adam is a good guy and he can only know the things he has been exposed to. And he genuinely seems to be trying to be a nudge for good in the world. For that i give him all due credit. But i want to say that even if you are absolutely broke with nor regular income, you can get food if you look for it correctly. Its out there. It may not be awesome or even subpar. But it will keep you alive long enough to find something better. But as Joe Roagans sensei told him once, sometimes they die. \n You might die at some point. The chances of it are high. So far as we know everyone who ever lived has or will die. \n Dont let that stop you from living though. You have some limited degree of controll over when it happens.

Any colour should work I believe, I use orange.\n- Finely chop a big onion, put it in a pan with a decent bit of butter, cook it fairly low to soften. Throw in some cumin and turmeric. I'll do a bit of cayenne and paprika too, but they're less important in my opinion.\n- Mince some garlic (maybe 3-4 cloves), a piece of ginger maybe the size of one garlic clove if you have it (you can also just do garlic/ginger powders instead probably), add those once the onions are soft and translucent. I also add a tablespoon or so of soy sauce here to get the umami flavour since there's no meat. Mix this and cook for up to a minute.\n- Pour in a can of tomato sauce, stir together, add a bit of water if you need to (probably half a cup or so). Turn the heat up to maybe a low medium\n- Drain the lentils, stir them in to the sauce. This is also roughly when I'll put rice on (I cook it on the stovetop). You can add bay leaves if you have them, not super important though.\n- Stir the curry occasionally, and when you feel the rice is nearly done, stir in a few spoons of plain yogurt, or a similar amount of cream, though again this isn't crucial\n- Fluff the rice and let it air a bit, and stir in some garam masala to the curry if you can get it. If not, add whatever parts of it you can source and taste for flavour\n\nPersonally, we keep most of these ingredients stockpiled because they're all pretty versatile; lentils I've had to go out of my way to get, but they last for ages and are very cheap in bulk. You can adapt this to use more vegetables, more seasonings, or whatever fits your own lifestyle better, this is just where the balance lies for me :)", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@coryman125", "channel": "UC0mLWgaxsz0JBvnqHSW-CGA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_k-WCC_Dgwx4kNFrip3Ul1Bb_aOS3tWXDQicA3THas7MQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741344720.455715}

{"cid": "UgypjSKOI7b3_VHrY6J4AaABAg", "text": "I have so much issues with this. Mostly because the problem isn’t the cost of the food it’s the cost of time. Let’s take the pizza example, a 5lb bag of flour. Is about $6.50 where I live. It’s also a pantry item I often keep in my pantry. Let’s say your dough recipe is 500 g of flour and makes 4 pizzas that’s 35cents, salt if a few cents. Yeast for a pizza is going to be like 40cents. Let’s say 10 cents in oil. Let’s say $4 for the canned tomatoes. And that it makes 3 batches of 4 pizzas so about 66 cents per pizza. And the cheese is let’s say it costs $18 6lb for the cheese something you can freeze and store for up to a year easily. And let’s say you use 8 oz on a 13 inch pizza. Which brings it to about $1.50 per pizza That brings the cost for the raw ingredients to lets say $4 per pizza. Then ant 2.5KW for the oven running it for 1.25 hours at say $0.30KW/hr since i live in California that’s 3.13 for the electricity bringing you to $8 for the pizza. That is definitely as cheap if not cheaper than a restaurant. The problem is that to make the pizza you need to wait one hour for the oven to heat up. You need to have the foresight to have either premade pizza dough or time to make the pizza dough etc. But costs wise cooking at home has you beat. All with basically pantry or pantry style items. Not to mention you can have a lot of variety by mixing things up. If add some spices and change out the cheese with chicken breast add in a splash yogurt and some spices and you can make naan and something similar to chicken tikka masala. Change out the cheese for garbanzo beans lemon and garlic, and the tomato for canned red bell pepper with some other pantry items, you can make hummus, mahummara and pita. The problem is time not the cost and the idea that you need to make the same thing rather than understanding that you can use the same ingredients with minor substitutions to make a wide variety of dishes.

After being so poor I fed my car instead of myself some days I have a really good understanding of just how easy it is to simply eat your money. At any scale of purchasing power you can just eat all your money. I find a lot of people are both stubborn and uneducated about how to shop and how to avoid those marketing traps. 10 years ago I had to survive on like $10-ish a week in food and when I look at prices today.. it would still work. Maybe more like $15 to guarantee it could be done today.\n\nCooking from scratch. Freezing things you can leverage later or in other ways. Learning how to leverage ingredients you have rather than buying random 1-off ingredients. Growing herbs is actually a huge saver if you like to have fresh ones. Cue my basil addiction.\n\nI just made a spaghetti with a can of basil-garlic tomato paste. With a bunch of cardamon pods, cinnamon, oregano, cumin, garlic & onion powder, dark soy, onions, garlic, ground beef. \nAbsolutely delicious and that's not a dish with any kind of recipe involved. I start with a base idea in my head based on what I have at home and then I taste and wing my way through it.\nIf I had an angry italian grandma I'd tell her I cook to eat tasty food, not to preserve honor or whatever lol.\nMexican chorizo is awesome on pizza btw. Mind the oil.\n\nA lot of poor people really shop... poorly. Anything frozen that's not a meat or veggy or difficult pastry is probably a waste of money. Anything consisting of more than 1 ingredient in a sealed container is probably a waste of money. Canned beans are luxury priced bean.

{"cid": "UgxnkSl_LsfvAo-5f894AaABAg.AFM0GH2neQ4AFMHBp1PUl6", "text": " @DeltaSkylar201  Well thank you.\nFrozen veggies are usually cheaper and obviously can last longer than fresh. Beans, potatoes, eggs, milk, and chicken were like my staple foods. I'd buy giant packs of chicken and then portion that into bags to freeze once home. Spices can seem expensive but you don't have to replace them too often. So you can buy like 1 of those at a time.\n\nDon't buy any of those meats that are pre-seasoned or come with a bunch of veggies. In general look at and understand the price-per-lb tier and kinda know what it should be. If you can buy big packs of meat and process it you'll pay less and have scraps you can use to make a stock.\nFor example I recently got a bone-in 10lb pork shoulder for like $9. It was a steal but I did spend a lot of time cutting it down, portioning and freezing. But that's 3 meals of adobo that will feed 3 people.\n\nCurry, spaghetti, fried potatoes, chili, \"soup\", fried rice are all things you can just toss ingredients into a pan and then throw your own kind of seasoning profile at. I mean I like beans in my fried rice lol. Learn how to balance flavors. Salt, acid, fat, sweet, spicy all kind of interact. Other people can explain better.\n\nMy current favorite easy meal is 200 grams of flour, 2 eggs. Make that into noodles. 1lb of ground beef. Onion and garlic.Then just season it. I've had it taste like curry and like tacos. I have no recipe but it is always a winning unique dish lmao. Making noodles isn't so easy or fast but I just enjoy it.\n\nMuch of saving money on food can come at a cost of trading your time. Some things are not worth your time unless you do a GIANT batch. One example is tomato paste. But like making fresh noodles is kinda nice compared to those dry ones.\nCanned beans vs soaking overnight + 1-2hrs simmering is a good tradeoff. Using the video as an example, adam cooked like 3-5 cans of beans there basically at a fraction of the cost. Even making your own refriend beans is better. Healthier, tastier, muscle building xD.\n\nFigure out dishes you can make to use up your regular grocery runs. And freeze some portions so you can maybe skip that 3rd day of eating enchiladas or whatever. Then you just have a frozen meal ready for later.\n\nI even freeze tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni and dough for pizzas in portions. \n\nI really stand behind having a good stock of spices and knowing how to use them + how to cook different ingredients. After practice and disasters you'll really be able to raid whatever is left and make something reasonably filling and tasty even when the kitchen feels void of ingredients. watching lots of chefs helps learn new tricks too.", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@Nocare89", "channel": "UCK5MOd1V42BR1CdctpqszGA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_ku1SskBnWKkS1BOQrlCv6O15XVI2qrycOi_68P-pm_Bg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741344723.580602}

{"cid": "UgwgRakQVn1pIsdzTqx4AaABAg.AFLzASq6UqNAFM08xp6O4t", "text": "Something I've come to learn about dessert is it has to be psychologically satiating. Oreos are not. That's why a sleeve goes like nothing. Popped like pills, not much flavor beyond just pure sweet, texture's not much. A decent slice of cake with somethin' crumbly-crunchy on top could be half the sugar and I can walk away after the one slice. Denseness and richness (thick, chewy desserts are the ticket) and texture and pacing really help with overdoing dessert. Instead of seeking out more sugar (because our brains are actually evolved to trigger more appetite when we get sugar; the 'I got a second stomach for dessert' saying is not literal but figuratively near to truth), seek satisfying textures and such. And with something like KIND or granola bars, don't chomp right in. Pick at 'em, take little nibbles of sweetness. I break a granola down grain by grain sometimes. One bar can last me twenty minutes while I'm catching up on TV or some work or whatever. The dessert stretching over more time also creates a greater sense of satisfaction. Savoring food and whatnot.\n...Mind, I suspect I also have sensory deficiencies so maybe it's just me who needs more texture and such to get the worth of dessert. Fun fact: Ben of Ben & Jerry's can't smell anything and because smell is actually a huge dimension of flavor, his means of differentiating food is largely down to texture and extremes of taste. It's why their whole schtick is piling hyper-sweetness over fifty different textures of thing no matter the flavor of the pint.", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@Tvaikah", "channel": "UCkhTCWQM06bPWVPO1zL_Z_A", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/-NDdpdVT8k2gE0y9ej8iQkBJRk--pra24XlElwFcPb1zerjL1--vcaO7IPcYbHwqND6VXbfpqQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741344726.114671}

It may be worth looking up the work of economists and academics such as Richard Wolfe, Michael Hudson, David Harvey, Jason Hickel, Kohei Saito, Ann Pettifor, and others in a similar vein.\n\nOur economy is built on a hegemony that is provably false... the idea of infinite growth in a system with finite resources. The assumption that our economy fairly rewards hard work or innovation breaks down when you factor in structural inequalities (such as disabilities and such), market failures, and the fact that those with capital tend to accumulate more at the expense of those without. I genuinely do not believe that the fruits of our economic system can be distributed equally in our system. The only path to truly equal distribution is through us laborers owning the means of our own production, which we do not and I'd argue cannot in our current economic system.

{"cid": "UgwGRh8KUt7pMlpdvYN4AaABAg", "text": "You had me until you said that you're glad living in an economic system that incentivizes people to work hard to become less poor... That's not how the economic system is set up, lol. All the poor people I know in my life are not poor through any lack of work ethic or laziness. We all work our butts off and are underpaid, overworked, and exploited. I've had the privilege of working an office job in the tech sector, something that most people have been conditioned to see as something achieved through hard work, and it was so much easier than anything I've ever done at any retail job I've worked at, plus I was being paid a living wage. \n\nThe incentive to work hard to become less poor is an intentional falsehood; we work harder so we produce more labor and thus value for our companies - those that perform well are kept in their low-wage, physically grueling positions because they're more valuable producing labor in that position. Again, in this economic system, profit maximization is all that's prioritized, not the human spirit or welfare, of course this will happen. \n\nI would also say that the work I've provided in retail jobs has produced more direct tangible value to society than something than maintaining an e-commerce application or selling overpriced health insurance to people could. This is especially considering that it would be much more efficient not only in terms of labor but also emotional labor to have a single-payer healthcare system that wouldn't deny people's claims randomly just to milk more money out of them and maybe not let providers and pharmaceutical companies over-inflate prices so laissez-faire. Indeed, a lot of jobs in our economic system like advertising, insurance sales, the dieting industry, and whatnot are mostly superfluous and provide little to no value, and we'd all have to work a lot less and enjoy life more under a more efficient, humane economic system, but that's another discussion entirely. \n\nAlso, here in the United States, meat is high priced despite abundance largely in part due to illegal cartels being formed between agricultural companies. They share pricing information among other things to keep prices inflated. There are active lawsuits the government is involved in regarding these cases, but its yet to be seen if anything will actually happen. Meat didn't used to be so prohibitively expensive. There also used to be cheaper cuts of meat, but most all of them have been gentrified and glorified in some way through social media and the prices skyrocketed to be not much less than more appealing cuts of meat.

Go to the meat space. Look for discounted near out of date items or specials thst are beyond standard catalogue.\n\nThen based off what you can get vs how much you need, vs how many portions which takes time to figure out but base your meals off this and then go back to the vegetables and fruits to collect ehats needed.\n\nI make 4 litres of Bolognese with only a kilo of beef mince. Deep tomato and onion base.\n\n4 litres of chilli\n\nOr burger meat from chopped steak\n\nChicken thighs stored flat in zippy bags and freeze like sheets.\n\nI pull my finished meal or meat to prep from the freeze and finish.\n\nMost my meals are cooked half way allowing more time for other things. Spend 2 afternoons prepping meals but since you freeze them i always have a week or two of meals to rotate through never eating the same meal more than twice if there is leftovers.\n\nPut vegetables in everything. If you can hide it, add it.\nExample.\nAdd a shredded carrot into chilli.\nShredded zucchini into curry.\nBroccoli florets into past spirals \n\nLast big tip.\n\nHave two massive pots.\n\nFill one with potato carrot and Broccoli \n\nThe other with zucchini, cauliflower or any other semi firm vegetable.\nPumpkins good but i roast mine in foil and add after.\n\n\nChop thick and basic.\n\nBoil. Till soft.\n\nStrain and mix together.\n\nAdd garlic paste, mustar, salt butter and rough mash.\nFinish with parsley and frozen peas.\n\nScoop into bags based on portion requirements.\nAnd freeze \n\nCongratulations you have a vegetable mash that is delicious for any protein, fried with bacon as a hash / bubble squeak,\nOn toast. With eggs.\nAnd now you have all the veg taken care of without the need to boil and mash every day, prep vegetables every day. I can do 2 weeks of vegetables and not do more than microwave for 2 minutes and boom.\n\nYou can evenmake basic chunks and roast.\nAlso you can use all the vege scrap to make stock.\n\nBeing efficient isnt difficult just enjoy finding what you like, analyse how to attack the problem and be creative.

Soy sauce is a must for making anything taste spot on even if just a few drops on the rice. I'll also hoard any and all sauce packets I get lol. However for the ingredients you listed here's what I do as a basic white lady who doesn't specialize in Asian cooking but wants option in my general kitchen: \nGinger- I keep powdered spice on hand (sometimes I can get a pack for like a buck) and it's good in bakery as part of pumpkin pie spice. Fresh ginger keeps a while but can be frozen. Also good as tea.\nGarlic- kept for general basic, also like garlic powder on a pinch\nGreen onions- this is tricky but they can be frozen. Can also be grown in garden and also there's some varieties that are perennial so will last and last\nOyster sauce- rarely use so can't justify keeping on hand. I try to substitute a little soy sauce but any other ideas?\nStar anise- I skip this but will keep eye out for sale. Can the same type be used for baking sweets?\nCumin- always on hand because it's a cheap spice and also great in Mexican food. I basically taught myself to use it a lot as it's so easily available. What do you put it in for Asian items? I've only seen it mainly as part of curry.\nFermented veggies- generally skip as I don't use them enough. A small jar of kimchi can be nice though \nWhite vinegar- household staple, everyone should have if only for cleaning, good general purpose substitute for rice vinegar in small dose\nCooking wine- I know this can really make home cooking taste like restaurant food but seems like extra expense. I barely buy cheap wine for drinking. Any suggestions?\nChili bean paste- occasionally I'll have Sriracha but I don't use it enough so when prices rose I stopped. \nRice- this should be in EVERYONE'S cupboard. Basic white or brown long grain rice is under a dollar a pound and such a good staple for almost any cuisine. I'll freeze it for ease of use later.

I also sometimes do things like Home Chef, because I've found that when I figure how much it will cost me to get the ingredients for the nice meals without buying in bulk (which usually results in some of it going to waste), getting it from a meal prep service comes out to about the same price and there's less prep and shopping involved.

Adam can still prefer the idea of capitalism while also recognizing its failings, which he does in this video, and its not even the main point he presents. However some of the comments here would have you believe that hes a deep anti-commie. He just said he likes the idea of incentives for working smart and harder, not that the current system is balanced or that its even the only way to do things. \n\nBtw, Im not a fan of capitalism, but i recognize how its failed.

I wouldn't dream of eating the same thing for 6 meals in a row - that is absurd to me. I shop at Lidl for two and our weekly shop is about $60 (I converted the currency). We eat varied but quite simple meals - a lot of pasta, probably at least 4x a week. Chicken usually twice a week and maybe beef once.\n\nWhat I will say, is that if you are wealthy enough to eat out every day and claim that is somehow \"cheaper than cooking\", please do not claim to be poor - you are either pretending to be poor, or are keeping yourself poor through your spending habits. If I could afford 2x$14 a day just for my dinner, I'd be in the top 5% of earners or so, I think. Just learn to cook, or at least learn to reheat pre-made stuff etc. I eat out probably once every 2-3 months or so, as a treat, because that is what I can afford, for now. Maybe I will treat myself more when I'm earning more!\n\nI understand that second paragraph may not translate so well to other countries - I've heard groceries and especially fresh food is a lot more expensive in America. But I'm sure it can't be so bad that it's really cheaper - although I do take the point that eating stuff with lots of individual ingredients is difficult to make at home.

In the current industrialized system, animals do eat a lot of things that come from resources that could have grown human food, but animals also eat grass, random seeds, bugs (which we could eat but usually don't want to), and waste products from other industrial farming systems like corn husks, other plant fibers, and even \"food waste\" (food that humans may have otherwise eaten but didn't).", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@josephmcgowan9936", "channel": "UCnTyLhZLgq5RNLh4DO8p_hg", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_npxQ_qC-q2jLdSd7xtVsaEH2iG7_oUavqYs-5a-Sg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344734.927725}

Especially if you have spare time but not spare money, they are both great pass times that can result in cheap groceries. When I first got married my wife and I both worked part time and I was in college. We had very little money but luckily we live in family land that has a couple ponds and small game and whitetail deer. We out of necessity developed a habit of building a diet around wild game (way more so than fish, but fish on occasion) that still to this day (16 years later) we hold true to. With the exception of the occasional bacon, sausage and even rarer chicken, we don't really buy meat; I honestly have no idea when the last time we bought any beef was. But even without owning or having access to private land, most states have large sections of national forest and other public lands that require only a hunting permit. And because they aren't framed, they are really a secondary agricultural product; game will eat crops, but they get most of their food from browsing naturally occurring shrubbery and acorns and nuts.

Pork loin (whole) is $1.79/lb, grab a knife and slice. Canola is $3.65 per 1.5L, which will last you ages if you're not deep frying anything.\n\nWhat sucks up your food budget is not buying in bulk and not knowing how to cook, or not being able to cook (due to lack of stove, fridge, freezer, etc.). If you can, buy the basics, get some spices, get some cooking utensils, bowls, containers for the fridge, etc. and make a meal plan. Oh, and freeze. And stop buying loose vegetables, buy it in bags. Stop buying marinated fancy meats, buy bulk or primal cuts. Once you have that, solely eating rice & beans or packet ramen is just an excuse.

I've mentioned before in comments on your videos about how much of a struggle it all is - made more challenging still by caring for a man with end stage kidney disease.\nBeans really are an incredible food though. It's good to understand that bell pepper can give the nutrients that onions can, btw - I recently developed some level of allergy to onions and garlic so I've been forlornly gazing at my shallots and garlic powder and not using them often. I'll note that lentils are ALSO legumes and while they may not have quite the same \"oomph\" as black beans or kidney beans, they do have a bit less tendency to get the gut all upset. You can also add a teaspoon or so of Caraway seed to a pot of beans and it'll be less of an issue (and tastes okay too).\nBut most of all I appreciate what you're saying at the end of this. It's infuriating and disheartening how much our media and - I dunno, social attitude? - tend to hammer and hammer and hammer at the poor folks about how they're morally suspect, or stupid, or just plain not trying hard enough. It's so unfair to heap abuse on people already struggling. I get it - even the ones who want to help the most just run out of resources and energy after a while. The system isn't equitable, never was, and might never be, since pretty much all of what we live with (in the US at least) was put in place by powerful, wealthy folks who wanted to STAY wealthy and powerful, and had no intention of allowing their downtrodden to rise up and take any power or wealth for themselves.

{"cid": "Ugx2DCdTTSR0ectXNgJ4AaABAg", "text": "9:24\n\nYou're wrong - it's a myth that's been perpetuated way too much, but the truth is that a bell pepper (as well as tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers) IS a vegetable AND ALSO a fruit. The problem is how you use the term and in what context. Since you are cooking and not leading a botany class, it's a vegetable, not a fruit. \n\nVegetable is a culinary term and NOT botanical, in botany there is no term \"vegetable\". Fruit, on the other hand, is a term that is different when used botanically vs culinarily, and since most of us deal with food more often than the study of plants, colloquially the culinary term for \"fruit\" is the more common one, and by that definition a bell pepper is NOT a fruit because it's not something you would put in a fruit salad.\n\nThis is more apparent in other languages, such as Russian, that have a separate term for botanical fruit vs culinary fruit. In Russian, the botanical fruit of a plant is \"plod\" and has to do with the plant's reproduction. The culinary term for fruit is \"frookt\" and is referring to sweet fruits that are typically eaten for dessert or put in a fruit salad.\n\nAs an example of a similar situation, I could say that when you drive and apply brakes to your car, you are accelerating (even though you are braking). Why? Because acceleration in physics is change in velocity. Since by applying brakes you are changing your velocity (from fast to slow) that means from a physics perspective you are ACCELERATING, but try to give driving directions to someone by saying \"accelerate\" when you mean \"brake\" and you'll confuse a person and cause an accident. People sometimes say \"decelerate\" but once again, that is NOT a term in physics, it's meaningless, because accelerate is change in velocity, so there's no term for \"negative change\" in velocity, since negative change is just change, however colloquially we accept that accelerate means speed up and decelerate means slow down.

The staples, of course, beans, rice, potatoes, pasta, etc.  And if you can afford a little more, then yeah, you can supplement the staples and get some decent meals out of them.  I always try to keep bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes handy, and other fresh vegetables when I want something in particular, or can get them on sale.  Squash, zucchini, rutabagas, eggplant, sweet potatoes, whatever.  Canned veggies are always my backup for emergencies, especially peas, corn, and green beans.  I also do frozen veggies because they last a long time in the freezer and don't lose their nutritional value due to flash freezing processes.  My main frozen goto is broccoli, although I like to do Winter blend (broccoli and cauliflour) or California blend (broccoli, cauliflour, and carrots), and brussel sprouts.  Chopped spinach is also usually fairly cheap, but again, you just have to go to the stores and see what's cheaper.  \n\nI like my cheese, dadgummit, but I found that cream cheese is a little bit cheaper than block cheese, and makes a good substitute for other cheeses, is fairly versatile, as it can be used in both savory and sweet dishes. \n\nMeats?

He advocated for the creation of communal kitchens where people can still feel the joy of cooking when they want to, but also have ready access to high quality and low cost hot food. He also thought these kitchens would produce products for home cooks that they might need and would be inefficient to produce on their own in bulk such as stock.

Someone who has no time to do absolutely nothing becomes sick, often without being aware of it because it is a societally approved sickness.\nThere is no need to push people towards ingenuity.

Different times and different regions may have meat as a staple ingredient.\n\nIt is funny how your mind operates on scarcity mentality while at the same time being very wasteful.

The point I’m making is- who funds those venture capitalists?\n\nThose at the actual top of our society aren’t the 1%- they’re a tiny fraction of that. The richest of our society don’t make their money by owning a company or working hard, but by expanding existing wealth through speculation and markets- which is a lot easier to do if you start with enough money to bend the market to your will, which can be done easily enough by buying politicians. \n\nIf you don’t start with a bunch of money, you can’t expand it in this way and reach those heights of power. And those are the people who are actually capable of influencing our world. Which, again, they mostly do to balloon their wealth even further.\n\nIf you can’t double your wealth through forcing an economic recession, you’re not in the wealthy class. And only a tiny fraction- the so called 1% of the 1%, are that rich, and you can’t get there if you started from nothing- these people started from a pretty hefty something and have spent their whole lives multiplying their hoard.", "time": "3 giorni fa (modificato)", "author": "@healdrop9313", "channel": "UC9-eZFDebQPlUSP77vxVjeg", "votes": "2", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/eXeN8md3HR8mtBRVoQM6uEMHjMf3YLzh_MQ9trWq5t1S4kXkG9tYeg42YJYfB4zrWrIinLrjc-g=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741949552.870579}

Yes, people should not have to work two jobs to afford a room in someone else's house. Yes, necessary medications should not cost hundreds of dollars. Yes, nobody should have 450 billion dollars and be able to buy the government. However, there are SO many places in the world where people are terrorized by war, famine, or unjust social systems. Only 17% of the world's population lives in a developed country. So, yes, relative to most people on the planet, our lives are amazing and we have significant economic freedom. \n\nI almost feel it's disingenuous to say that the minority of people in this country can't move up the economic ladder by working hard. There are a variety of social systems in place (hopefully they stay in place) that can provide people with housing, jobs, healthcare, food, education, etc. Now of course there are extenuating circumstances where people can't access those systems, maybe because of geographic location or the social systems are overburdened or the individual themselves has some issue like drug abuse or disability, and those circumstances are where the shortcomings in the American system are most obvious, see: Appalachia, Kensington, Skid Row, etc. However, those extenuating circumstances are just that: extenuating. You CAN improve your lot in life by working hard. Is it unreasonably difficult in the US, a country that isn't terrorized by the aforementioned war and famine (note I exclude unjust social systems)?

So the mini was to give me something and I still use the mini which I put stock pots of giant batches of food in. It's mini but not so mini it doesn't store a lot of food and it has its own freezer that can actually store icecream and stuff so yeah I got a lot more fridge and freezer than you for a tenth the cost.\n\nSo my tip. Buy the display model. Especially if it's one of a model that's going away. Because they want to get rid of it and selling it to you for a discount is better than paying to have it scrapped or something. So yeah, buy the floor display models. They are awesome and work great.

{"cid": "UgxC284bZn10Bjol0ft4AaABAg", "text": ">odds are if you're within the sound of my voice right now, you live in a country where you've never met a person who has rickets or scurvy\n\nWhile I 100% get the point of what you're saying, this line just made me giggle. Cause... while I live in the states, hell, I shopped at Publix just like you for the vast majority of my life. Yet I know SEVERAL people who have had scurvy, and one with rickets.\n\nBut, that's just the nature of statistics. While odds are, those odds suggest there are those on the other side. It makes me think of how my brother a couple years ago got ran over by a work truck giving him 'compartment syndrome' (it's where pressure in a muscular compartment has restricted blood flow and can lead to nerve damage and even loss of limb). I brought my brother to the hospital, they couldn't handle the case and I then had to take him to the next (and yes, I drove him to both, because the interhospital ambulance was out of our budget). The hospital he ended up in was a teaching hospital full of med students so groups of them were excitedly coming by to check out the compartment syndrome because it's not super common and missing this case might mean missing it all together during their time there as a student. The students were commenting on this fact to us and we're like:\n\n\"Huh... this is like the 3rd case we've been personally party to. Let alone the people we've met who have had it in the past.\"\n\nNote... I get that could be interpreted as a little sad. But yeah, it make me giggle. I don't know why. Scurvy? Lol, we would throw lemons at our roommate cause he got scurvy.\n\nedit - and I reached the end of your vid with your somber note about poverty. Just wanted to say my \"ha ha, scurvy, lol\" was prior to that somber note. But it is true what you say about it's not necessarily your skills that make you poor, just a screwed up chance. And the reason I know many people who have had things like scurvy is because poverty. I thankfully dodged it just cause my mom knew how to navigate healthy food on a budget... which is to the whole skill thing. My mother was very smart, but dirt poor... brains don't necessarily give you everything to be wealthy despite what some tech bro thinks. I am a tech bro... technically... I'm a programmer/software engineer. I've had juniors under me scoff at poor people and when I give them a weird look they get real defensive or even ponder why I'm defending poor people when clearly I'm not poor and I worked hard for my money. I laugh and point out... no... I'm not wealthy. I grew up dirt poor and the only reason I'm where I am is not because of programmer smart brain, but because my parents died when I was 20, and the insurance money surrounding the accident gave me that little oomph to climb out of that hole. \"I earned my lot in life, I worked so hard at my 4 year degree.\" Honey... my father worked 100 hours a week for 30+ years.

The only real difference is the carb you're using and how you assemble everything together, and a lot of carbs are dried, or last a pretty long time. If you buy Tortillas for burritos, you can use them for for a lot of other things in the coming weeks. \n\nI'd agree with Adam if you're really, really struggling and just getting by, but I feel he's speaking from a really extreme example here, and most people probably have a bit more wiggle room if we're being realistic. \n\nAnother thing is just, be creative. There's no reason you can't make Pizza at home, but yes, if you're making 1 pizza, it isn't cost effective. You can 100% Freeze home made Pizza's though. Just Par cook them with just sauce on them and focus on getting the crust pretty well along, then next time you go to cook it, you really just need to let it defrost, and use the oven to crisp it up and melt the cheese/heat the toppings.

{"cid": "UgyiNVLtHmcZ1OvtlGN4AaABAg", "text": "I'm cooking up food for weeks right now, and yeah, it sucks. People say, \"Just work harder, just work smarter,\" but that idea just isn’t true anymore. We don’t just budget money—we budget energy. And cooking at home after work costs energy. Sure, it saves money if you could be working more instead, but when you’re already maxed out, it’s still a win.\n\nBut—and it’s a big but—there are only so many hours in a day, and energy isn’t infinite. The system we live in doesn’t just fail people; it actively grinds them down. You can’t just work harder or be smarter to keep up if you don’t even have the energy left to try. That’s something you should’ve done before you were poor—but of course, you couldn’t have known that then.\n\nAnd yeah, if we could work more, we could earn more. Maybe then we’d eat better, maybe we’d buy back some of our time. But that depends on your job, your qualifications—and you couldn’t have known back then what qualifications would matter now. Some people just got unlucky. And in my case? Other things happened, so it wasn’t even an option.\n\nYes, the system should be different. And sure, this isn’t the reality we live in. But why not make it a reality where being poor doesn’t mean barely surviving?\n\nAnd for those who say, \"Just get better qualifications!\"—how? We don’t have the time because we need to work for what little money we make. We don’t have the energy because we’re already stretched to the limit. And we can’t just take a break or switch jobs, because that means earning even less. When you’re only barely surviving, you can’t afford to take a hit.\n\nWe’re stuck. Really stuck. What we need is luck and a break—which, again, depends on luck. And even then, just catching a break isn’t enough. We’re so drained from years of grinding just to stay in place that before we can even think about improving our situation, we have to recover first. And that takes time. Being poor wears you down—mentally, physically. You work for years, you try harder and harder, and somehow it still gets worse.\n\nAnd funnily enough, the cheap foods that were supposed to be the safety net? They’ve gotten more expensive faster than the expensive foods. The basics—the stuff people rely on to stretch their budgets—are becoming just as unaffordable as everything else.\n\nSo if someone’s got a plan, please, do it. Because this?

In order for there to be something to work towards, there needs to be class divide. It's a really common failing of people in capitalist systems when analyzing said system to forget that it doesn't end with them. If the system \"works right\" everyone should be incentivized to work harder or smarter to get access to more luxuries. But that inherently means there's always a constant class of poor people to work out from. There's always someone in last place, there's always people being born into the class that has to work harder to get luxury. The system working as intended is, by design, equal parts working your way up the ladder and pulling yourself up by the bootstraps, and maintaining a population of poor people through no fault of their own. The system can't work if poor people don't exist, and yet it exists on the promise that with enough hard work everyone won't be poor. It's a system that's mission statement includes the ending of itself, and yet here we are decades down the line still tumbling further away from that possibility of everyone working their way out of poverty.

Even his statement at the end of the video directly goes against that meritocratic argument. It's not sugar coating, it's his opinion to like the idea of capitalism, but he clearly doesn't like the current results. Which means he's not blindly approving of the system just because it leans into what he'd normally intuit as fair. It's alright to wish that he'd be more heavily socialist, but it's strange to claim that he's actually some capitalist purist when he's being so critical of it in his own self-curated video. Tldr: he's not \"sugar coating\" meritocracy, he's someone who'd like to have meritocracy but recognized that's not how the world works right now.

People who work menial or labor focused jobs are not \"lower\" they are the backbone/foundation of our economy. But it is also true that these jobs require much less specialization and skill. The working class (better name for it) is necessary. Absolutely necessary, but so is the skills-focused class (doctors, plumbers, technicians, physicians). The main failure of capitalism is the fact that the capitalist class (those who own the capital) have been given too much control, which happens easily in capitalism. But to be clear, the working class is necessary and always will exist even in a communist framework. Even under capitalism, if our government did more than the bare fucking minimum, or worse collude with the capitalist class, a system resembling capitalism but redistributed much of the profits by taxes and workers rights and protections would fix a lot of issues people have. Advocating for a system that incentives hard work and higher efficiency DOES work when you also prioritize the well-being of the basic person in the system. There's no need to do one or the other.

The specifics of those luxuries and their real or imagined scarcity isn't really important, they're usually products of capitalism manufactured to be goals to chase indefinitely while also bolstering the wealth of shareholders and directors. As for the rest of your comment; these are all infinitely complex concepts and systems, and bringing a global lens to it is only one facet of the argument. There's people who's entire lives are dedicated to research and writing on one small aspect of leftist critique and even then the discussion never feels finished in any meaningful way. It's easy to get yourself trapped in those thought patterns of global scale and systemic woes pitted against individual action and exploitation, but all that really does is result in you spinning your wheels. There are actions we as individuals can take to ease the wrong doings of a capitalist economy. There are also very large scale problems that cannot be fixed without huge systemic reform and the dismantling of entire systems of governance. Both things are true and don't make the other futile. At the end of the day, the reality is it's very hard to force change from underneath a global system. We're forced to play the game, so to speak, and there's a level of moral corruption forced upon us in that regard.

I.E buying a frozen lasagna from costco. Put it in the oven, frozen, start oven at 350f and give it an hour and you're done. then eat it from that container and throw away the container.  I do this as well, but max 1 per week, when I am really running out of time.  But, me bigger issue is 3 things for me: 1. lots of recipe's need 15-20 ingredients (spices, etc), pre-making stuff, like marinades, and trimming, carving, other work than most people are not excited about, so these things are only done on special occasions.  Personally, I do something else - I make a big pot of something and vary sides with it - I.E i Make stewed beef chuck (a simpler version of any stew recipe u see on YT), like 10lbs. It has 5 ingredients total. It's good in fridge for a week at least. And, I vary sides for it, from rice, to pasta, to potatoes, to just putting in  a bun, to anything else. I.E Beans, or veggies. You can do same. Also, I Cook 10lbs at a time a mix of onions, peppers, 1-2 other veggie you like. Then when you need to have dinner, u put meat, veggies, and reheat over some kinda carb - complete meal in 15-20 min. You can vary spices and types of meat/veggies, so it'll never be boring. It won't look at good as a takeout, sure, but it'll taste likely better (it has everything you like). If you do things like that, yes, it'll take time and will take a bit of planning and adjusting to and how you shop and maybe buying a dedicated freezer, but it also = about $200-$400 a months savings in food, which is about $2.5-5k a year, invested  = alot of $ over the  next 30-40 years :)", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@Persian_Mafia", "channel": "UCJYaeOsfwewXjY-7D4X3qXg", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/qyN_JsxyRhufBfgobBVWex00w2kipBYCD0NGgEWQ_X4h75JF7nURY5Tc57Ka73t5k9yqSyxd=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344769.514816}

Secret is to buy bulk in first week like 10lb rice or big bags of pasta, oats.  Bulk prorien and 10lb onions, i only use ghee as fat so a 5lb of that, some dried beans and milk. 10$ worth of fresh veggies/flash frozen peas,carrots and other stuff for 2$ a bag.  Abput 50-60 bucks first week.  \nFrom next week I just buy meat, milk , veggies ,yogurt.  All in all I spend at max 250$ thats including whey protien for my bulk. I prep my meals and more times than not I have left over ingredients by the end of month like beans, rice etc. \nI hit all my macro goals and eat very healthy food for way cheaper than i would if i eat out. Easily 10-15 bucks for any decent meal if I eat out here in Toronto. \n \nBut its not easy the amount of time and effort to plan,shop,prep,cook,clean is a giant task. But once you get into the groove of it, the upfront cost  maybe a little steep depending on your equipment, comdiments etc but its extremely worth it. \n\nOh i also buy dry spices every 3_4 months , may be costs me like 30-50$ bucks but they last forever. \n\nIts very possible and beneficial.

{"cid": "UgylcEX4Yw75AWaH__d4AaABAg.AFLK6XuBkqPAFLayq8Hg_D", "text": "You nailed it right on the head there. It's a surprisingly common take. Most people dislike wealth inequality and don't think poverty is anything anyone should ever have to experience. BUT if you ask them if someone who didn't work as hard as they did, should not get the same \"rewards\" (ie. the same level of human joy, comfort and pleasure) they will almost universally say NO.\n\nBecause built into this culture mindset of individualism, is the idea that you have to have some else to compare yourself against to feel validated.  If someone worked less and ended up better than you, then that makes you some how worth less. And it's through hard work and the desire to \"better\" ones experience, that we derive worth and value to ourselves and society.\n\nIt's so blatantly capitalist propaganda but you can't really point that out, because it's so deeply ingrained in western culture that people take it for granted and are mostly prevent from realizing it.\n\nAnd in a cruel twist of irony, Adam has literally spoken about his experiences with this. He's already \"won\" the race, and become super successful and doesn't need to work again.  And he's struggled (struggling?) with the fact that this hasn't made him happy. He isn't able to sit back and enjoy the good life.   According to this mindset he should be able now to sit smugly in the comfort of his rewards.   Unfortunately I don't think he's quite realized yet, is his dissatisfaction is a result of the whole idea being a lie/illusion.  You are on a treadmill chasing a carrot, that you are never supposed to reach. Once you step off and realize that you haven't actually been going anywhere, can only lead to a feeling of emptiness.\n\nOn an unrelated note, it is also a contributing factor to the pathology of billionaires. They have \"WON' at the game, and so should be happy. But they aren't, and that's why they keep making money, keep reaching in that never ending cycle of greed. Because all they've been taught is that this pursuit will lead to validation and meaning.

{"cid": "UgwOGfkiUQNfEjeTo4V4AaABAg", "text": "I really hate a lot of the cooking discourse. Influencers will be like \"this is a cheap easy meal for only 2$ a portion! Just buy a chicken breast, an onion, and then add these 15 ingredients you should have in your store cupboard and prepare it using these 5 pieces of expensive equipment you definitely have in your kitchen. It should be easy to make in only 20 minutes as long as you have already mastered knife skills, have 7 ramekins of preportioned ingredients and can multitask like a professional chef\"\n\nProblem is, if you're a single person living in an apartment who was never taught cooking, you don't have a fully stocked store cupboard with 15 ingredients and you might not have any kitchen equipment besides a burner and microwave. The startup cost is enormous and if you're not already a good cook who can make use of all the random stuff you have leftover that you only needed a small amount of for the recipe, you're wasting so many ingredients you won't be able to use. If you're not already good at cooking, that 20 minute recipe becomes an hour and a half, and cost $30 with all the \"store cupboard\" ingredients they assumed you already have. Half the time you aren't even good enough at cooking to produce an edible result so it just tastes awful for all that time and money. And if you're cooking for 1 instead of a family you have zero economy of scale, and a lot of times the serving sizes of the stuff that's sold affordably just aren't feasible for one person to use before they expire even assuming you're good enough to utilize them well in the first place. There's even the assumptions of like, I have a car to go buy huge packages of bulk ingredients when I am actually walking to the grocery store alone and carrying my stuff back by hand in tote bags or using the bus.\n\nIf I'm really trying to save money, actual affordable eating looks like degenerate girl dinners, just eating the most calorically dense to cost ratio food with the least processing and extra ingredients required. When I backpack on a shoestring budget and stay at hostels I eat stuff like bananas or refried beans heated up between tortillas or even just with a spoon from the can. They come pre spiced and are cheap and compact. The reason ramen is popular struggle food is that it's cheap, yes, but for the price it comes with all the seasoning and flavor included so you don't need to add anything else.\n\nPlus, cost of cooking vs just buying food varies a ton depending on where you live, how much you need to eat, and what you're getting. I used to get lunch at a local indian restaurant for the equivalent of like 6 dollars, and it was a super filling nutritious vegetarian meal. A banana for breakfast is like 20 cents. And for dinner I'd buy something premade from the grocery store for like another $6 ish. Whenever I'd try to cook I'd usually end up in the red due to general inexperience and lack of ingredients. Sure I could eat bean soup and rice every single day for $3 a meal instead of 6 but it's such a small savings compared to the struggle and effort. Hell as sad as it is, you can get like 1200 calories of mcdonalds for $5 if you don't care about your health and just want calories. Now on the other hand if I lived in a more expensive place where buying a meal cost $15 then cooking becomes a much bigger savings.", "time": "10 giorni fa (modificato)", "author": "@soasertsus", "channel": "UCmbSN86O-46l3R65r-iDTEw", "votes": "80", "replies": "18", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_k0PVo4Ayjzf9FlRcdjZAQYBwK430_hLvWlP9jgikQjC65W-ONDWjkk4dykteuHJ96HgQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344771.668821}

There is a reason that society's views have shifted to the fact that for example, the very existence of a Billionaire is immoral, no matter how much philanthropy they perform.  Obviously a food YT isn't a billionaire, but the same idea holds.\n\nThere are going to be plenty of people watching this video for whom $15K could be a life changing amount of money. That doesn't mean Adam didn't work hard for his money, the YT hussle is no joke, a large amount of effort, and luck/good timing are involved.  But it's also psychologically proven that we are really bad at over believing how much of our success is due to our own effort and individualism. \n\nBut that makes it so easy to cut the other way and very subtley espouse the idea that people who haven't been that fortunate, didn't do what you did, and that is what makes you different.  It's not that they deserve their situation in life, it's just that you got yours because you deserve it.   So much of that is ingrained in western culture, that inherent desire to compare ourselves against others to make us feel validated.  You can't have the idea that everyone deserves to live in abundant joy and happiness, and eat \"good food every night\", because that would somehow make the fact that you do it worth less.\n\nI still like the video, there are good aspects, but you just can't erase this one point of it.  You sadly don't get to spend $15k \"unintentionally\" on a fridge, and still talk about \"poor people\", just because you didn't want to spend that money in the first place and so you aren't one of the \"bad ones\".

If you're just cooking chicken with no spices or seasoning you may as well not even cook chicken since it won't taste good anyway and should make something that uses cheaper and pre-spiced ingredients. To get good at any skill requires a lot of messing up and a lot of trial and error and that becomes paradoxical when you're trying to save money because you have to spend a lot of money (and time) messing up before you get to the point where you can save money reliably. Like every new cook has spent 30$ buying ingredients for a recipe that they somehow screwed up royally to the point that it's unsalvageable and now you're in the red. Again, there are start up costs a lot of people just overlook and a lot of skills people don't recognize involved and the advice ends up being like \"just cook a stir fry bro\" as a result. \n\nWeird analogy but I notice the same thing with like high ELO League of Legends players trying to give advice to noobs, they take for granted so much assumed knowledge and subconscious things they're doing that they're actually incapable of understanding or giving useful advice to a new player and just say platitudes like \"get more gold and die less\" not understanding the enormous gulf of practical knowledge and experience that goes into that. The best people to give advice to low ELO players are mediocre players who are just a little bit better than them and can still relate to what it was like being a noob. In the same way, the actual cooking advice that's helped me is never from food influencers but instead from normal people who are still only one step removed from being a terrible cook themselves and can give practical tips for my level.

{"cid": "UgzW2ItU1duSwCIcgqp4AaABAg", "text": "I'm watching this video while eating a bowl of stew that I made ~10lbs of the other night for under $10. Thank you Adam for teaching me how to cook, teaching me how to cook cheap and healthy, and for being so self-aware.\n\n(If you're curious here is my \"recipe\")\nIn the morning, soak a bag of black beans.\nBuy one pork shoulder. Chop off the fat cap and all the white inedible sinew bits. Reserve the rest of the meat, then cut the fat & sinew into chunks. Put a little water in a dutch oven and throw the chunks in there; stir it occasionally on medium-high heat to get the fat to render out. It will look like garbage at first but hold faith. If the fond at the bottom is at risk of burning you can deglaze it with water to reset your burning timer (I did this like 4 or 5 times?), but be careful cause you can get a lot of fat in that pan and it can bubble quite vigorously when adding water. After you get a lot of oil in the pan you can add some spices to steep in the hot oil, I used curry powder and paprika and Pizza Hut pepper flakes but any hot strongly-colored spice will do.\nWhile that's rendering, chop up 2 white onions into whatever shape and about 1/3 of the pork roast into cubes. Freeze the rest of the roast. I think I rolled the cubed pork around in some salt and pepper to \"\"\"marinate\"\"\" but it probably doesn't matter.\nDeglaze the pot with some flavorful liquid (i don't have any WHITE WINE so I used rice vinegar), then use tongs or whatever to take the horrid bits of pork out. You could probably leave them in the pot if you were really strapped for cash but I just chucked them, they have an awful texture.\nFry the onions in the pot, then fry the pork. Pour the beans in (I drained the soaking water but whatever) and some water to cover. Then yeet whatever spices in, I think I used an italian spice mix, MSG, and garlic powder. I also put some whole spices (peppercorns, rosemary, and bay leaves) in a metal tea strainer to hang it in the pot, this way you can take it out at the end to avoid peppercorn jumpscares when eating it, but whatever.\nWhile that's all cooking chop a small mountain of waxy potatoes. Potatoes don't really shrink as they cook so cut them to the size you want to eat them. Dump them in, stir, add more water to cover. At this point the stew was a weird greenish-brown color so I put a bunch of gochujang (spicy Korean fermented pepper paste) in which made it redder. You can get it pretty cheap at an asian grocery store, it comes in a red flip-top container. I cannot say enough good about gochujang in stews, it makes it taste like you developed the flavors for days. (Because someone did develop the flavors for days! If I could beam one piece of information into Adam's mind to share with his audience it would be **USE GOCHUJANG IN STEWS**)\nWhen the beans are like 3/4 done pour some canned corn in. I like whole kernel corn with peppers in it because that way I don't also have to chop and buy peppers.\nAnd when the beans are finished cooking and the potato chunks are getting battered around the edges, add salt or better than boullion or whatever, and serve.\n\nThe pork shoulder was $17 at Target and everything else I had lying around. (My roommate had bought the potatoes and onions like 6 months ago and forgot about them. Most of the onions had gone bad but there were 2 good ones, and all the potatoes were good). Given I only used half the pork shoulder I'm saying it was \"about $10\".\n\nThe pork is only like 1/10th of the volume of the stew at the end, so you're getting a good money's worth and I like the fun flavor contrast of finding a pork lump, like a marshmallow in Lucky Charms or whatever.

Frankly, back when Adam's channel was growing through here and shares on Reddit, I really enjoyed the approach, but I think he is hitting a sort of tough and stagnant spot. Some bits, like the very beginning of the video, give an impression of bitterness towards other types/styles of channels (I would assume it was an intended point towards Weissman), but these kinds of things really make me less interesting in viewing the rest of the video. Around the same time as Adam's channel surge, Weissman was having some success too, and expanding in all sorts of different directions.\n\nMaybe it is the divide between the comfortable home cooking family element compared to Weissman's more \"restaurant experienced\" and spread of content, but to me these both represent fairly separate cooking and food priorities. Many of my friends in the restaurant industry have a bit of an edge to them personality wise, and I think people who approach all cooking content with that more wholesome and 'economic' standpoint get turned off easily by those fairly typical mannerisms. There may be an element of going in with the wrong expectations, but I find people get really egotistical themselves when seeing people taking pride in their work/ opinions (often from experience).\n\nRegardless, I still enjoy Adam's insight and unique topics they cover, I just hope they sort of step back from the bitter vibes I've been noticing more and more of.

{"cid": "UgwKBNPbYZ1lBZ2PQcV4AaABAg.AFLGJg_eIUrAFa_t7VTSJg", "text": "I asked these questions from a sales rep before:\nA domestic fridge is designed to be opened and closed 20-30 times a day for 3-7 years depending on the brand. A commercial fridge is designed to be opened and closed 300 times a day for 15 years. The hinges could use rubber, plastic, nylon or self-lubricating UHMW polymers. Those 300 closings are expected to be slammed with your feet or butt, so instead of using self-tapping screws and adhesives for the shell, they have to use self locking nuts and bolts with threadlock. The compressor is designed to bring a room temp interior to refrigerated in less than 30 minutes, typically 12-15 minutes, while a domestic fridge has 2 hours.

The modern daily hot shower is an extremely unsustainable practice that is less energy efficient than an ancient roman bathhouse. \n\nIt's unfortunate that we have so few social mechanisms to do things like cooking and growing food communally outside of private business.", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@v1deo_vid", "channel": "UCJ1cT5t-BJhR0IQ6MfVW0cw", "votes": "254", "replies": "21", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_li55Jw7jThedhC0Blq3DKB0OJPW9M9S6Q3A79rXXNG6VA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741344794.167848}

I remember talking with some of my friends who grew up in other countries (mostly western africa and south asia) and the sheer amount of people who would talk about their neighbors or family friends in the same way they would talk about direct family is wild. In many parts of the world, it's just expected that neighbors and extended family would be happy to take care of each others' kids in times when their direct parents were stuck at work or were struggling financially and there was zero shame attached to it. That pales in comparison to how many kids grow up here where parents are super competitive, neighbors don't really know each other that well, and being viewed as \"poor\" was something to be ashamed of rather than showing you needed help. I mean, we even used to have that in the US where my own parents would tell stories about how linked their neighborhood was or how they would constantly come together when things got bad. Nowadays you just have parents who NEED to constantly be working just to survive combined with the lack of communal childcare so kids suffer the brunt of it while parents don't catch a break.\n\nEdit: and to clarify: yes they came here due to suffering at home, but that's one thing they talk about missing greatly back home. They would talk about how yes, the greater economic prosperity and possible safety benefits are genuinely good things about coming here, but they didn't expect how HARD it would be to raise a kid given that you're just expected to kinda do it on your own.

Sure you can probably save money by boiling down bones to stock. There are plenty of ways to cut costs.\nBut a large portion of those methods are being proposed by content creators that do it as their full time job, that's their only responsibility. It's a very different situation when someone is doing that after getting home from their full time job at 6pm with a family to take care of, and those recipes often make an assumption of unlimited time and energy.\nI was doing the math last year on a lot of homemade things I was cooking, and I realized that they cost more for me to make than in a restaurant. The ingredients were cheaper, but if I had calculated in the value of taking the couple of hours I spent making a dish like a lasagna, I'd be looking at $100+ worth of time if I was at work.\nThat's not to say it's a waste, I enjoy cooking, that's why I do it. But there's an argument to be made that if someone strongly dislikes cooking and views it as being as unpleasant as work, it might not make sense for them to cook much, and just spend that time putting in an extra hour at work then getting take out.

The fact that you get to view it as a \"hobby\", and not a regular routine of life is a privilege that I think has poisoned the well. If it costed say $75 a week for your laundry to be done magically in the same way you can order doordash for dinner, I think a substantial amount of people who economically shouldnt would pay that premium. I think it becomes problematic when people seem to ignore the agency they have in their own lives at the cost of their own ecenomic situation. It might make sense for some people to eat out every meal, or have a personal chef. But eating is a reality of life, there's no way around it. You either learn to cook or suffer the consequences of having that option unavailable to you. But cooking can be effectively learned by anyone, so lots of excuses ring hollow to me. The reason it sucks that cooking takes time is because it's a chore. Like many chores, people should be willing and ready to take logical and economical shortcuts, like bulk cooking and meal planning.

Some people can afford it, and that's fine, but for someone who has to worry about budgets, this really isn't an option. Suppose a single parent is raising two kids- takeout for a day is somewhere around $20 per person. For three people, that's $400 a week. At minimum wage, 22 hours of work- more than half a full time job. On the other hand, cooking a cheap meal every other day costs probably $10 + an hour of work every second day. That's $35 a week. One 8 hour day of work could pay for a whole month of food at that price.\nPersonally, I value my time outside of work very cheap, in the low single digits. $2 for a loaf of bread to save me a few hours is worth it (not to mention preservation).

Buying groceries was a huge shock because we were literally spending 2-3x what we would spend in the UK, but on the other hand things like petrol/gas was way cheaper (like, half the price) and in Walmart I saw decent-quality plastic tableware (re-useable tableware, not disposable ones) for literally $0.50 for a bowl or plate (€0.46).

I maintain a calorie deficit of 1500. I am not making horribly fancy meals or buying insanely priced cuts of meat. \n\nThis is milk, eggs, bacon, bread, pasta, and a variety of dairy products such as cheeses and butters. Veggies too, like broccoli, romain, arugula, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, carrots, etc. My protein is primarily seafood (whitefish and shrimp), chicken, beans, ground beef, ground turkey, and sardines because steaks are just too damn expensive. \n\nI am not buying unbelievably expensive brands of any of these products. I am not purchasing processed, pre-frozen foods. 99% of the time, the things I buy are generic store brands. The two exceptions would be the particular breads, cheeses, and milk I purchase, but these are only a few dollars more than your generic store brands. I would still be spending approximately the same amount regardless of these choices. \n\nI purchase these brands for a few reasons. I only buy Fairlife because I am not going to use a whole gallon jug of milk before it goes bad. I purchase Lewis brand breads because, surprise surprise, I will not use a full loaf of bread before it goes stale. As for cheeses, I don't buy incredibly fancy ones, but I do go a step above generic. I grate/shred cheeses when I use them. Generic brands in blocks don't melt right, they are coated in the same starches as the pre-shredded bags of cheese. These small deviations from cheapest of cheap do not change the overall monthly cost very much at all, at most by maybe $10-$20.  \n\nThis is approximately 1 months worth of groceries. My fridge is not large enough to fit one months worth of groceries, so I restock every two weeks. Every two weeks, I spend anywhere from $150 to $200, hence the valuation I've arrived at for my \"monthly grocery budget\" of $300-$400. \n\nWhen I see people posting \"proof\" that they're able to make luxurious meals on $150 a month just for themselves, I find this unbelievable. Even if you shopped at a Dollar Tree you are going to spend way more than $150 a month on groceries.\n\nI grew up in the 90's. I distinctly remember a FULL CART loaded to the top, practically spilling over, was at most $200. The same amount of money now barely fills a cart whatsoever.

Sometimes referred to as the Vimes Economic Theory of Boots (after a fictional character from Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld series) it is often just more expensive to be poor because when you are poor, you cannot afford to buy anything that lasts. Cars are a good example here, because they are often a virtual necessity in much of North America, you need to have one in order to work. But if you are poor, you can't afford a new one that has a warranty, you can't afford to bring it in to a shop to fix it up, and so you often just buy the POS that you can afford now, despite the fact that you will need to replace it sooner, and that it's likely going to cost you more on gas than an equivalent new car would.\nCars themselves being a virtual necessity to work in most of North America is another example in an of itself. The cost that goes in to owning a car is massive, from maintenance, to insurance to gas. This is all a cost that eliminates a person's ability to have money to spare on other things.\nFines. Breaking the law often results in fines, and there is a famous saying \"If the punishment for a crime is a fine, then that crime only exists for the poor\". A $100 fine for jaywalking certainly impacts the working poor much more than the well off, and while some countries do have more equitable systems that will adjust fines based on income or worth, most do not.\nBeing poor often means not having access to routine medical care (check-ups and what not), especially in the USA, and it is often way less costly to treat many serious ailments if you catch them early than if you only catch them after they start having a negative impact on your day-to-day\n \n There are many more examples and many papers on this topic, but I'll leave that as an exercise for you to discover. scholar.google.com is better than regular google for this type of research", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@Jaaxfo", "channel": "UC5YsMM0ubxHcxS_aOjsDLtA", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_k8xqR4dMoZL4jmbFCTXx0Oudfd4gZxIY7JvvLqZEM1XZI=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741344804.263803}

I 100% agree that it is possible (and many people do) work their way back from street homelessness. My areas of research work in public health are homelessness, substance use, and health behavior, and I've interviewed research participants with similar stories. \n\nBut you're right, I suspect we do disagree on solutions. Though I don't necessarily disagree that poverty (and the intersections that poverty has with subsistence living, crime, and substance use) generates a state of mind and way of social interaction that makes escaping difficult. I also don't disagree that among the \"less fortunate\" there are some pretty, let's say not-so-good people. But those people exist at every income level and in every demographic, they just aren't scrutinized the same way that people living in poverty are. At least from my own experience working in the community for about a decade now, conversing with community members and people who work with them, and the literature; I see the causality the other way around. Socio-structural factors perpetuate poverty, which drives both health outcomes and as you put it the \"culture\". I don't see it as possible to fix a downstream problem before an upstream one. I agree that the social services landscape has a wild number of problems, mainly being so overly bureaucratic that navigating them is next to impossible. \n\nIt's the same reason that criminalization of drug use doesn't hasn't solved the drug overdose or Hep C crises.

Including buying all the spices which I've got loads left over, and are now pantry staples, it probably cost about £150; probably a lot less; I wasn't keeping track. So approximately £5-£6 per meal.\n\n£50 of that was the meat. I could buy 2kg of chicken thighs for about £5 in Tesco, compared to I think 600g for £3. So if I'm just making a small amount, the price would skyrocket.

{"cid": "Ugzbw4fjxu2EPRNylPd4AaABAg", "text": "\"Cooking more economically\" is simply a fool's errand because I live alone. Sure, groceries are cheaper than fast/takeout food, but there are so many other things that I have to factor in as costs. Whether it's eating the same thing four days in a row because that's the only way to avoid food waste on, say, a pack of burger buns, or the cost of me being a less-than-restaurant-quality cook and occasionally screwing up a meal, or other actual issues relating to the quality and variety of home-cooked compared to takeout food, that's almost enough by itself.\n\nThe other factor? My time has value. Even if it's not directly measured in dollars and cents the way an hour of my time is valued by my employer, it's measured in things like psychological value—there are a finite number of hours between when I get home and when I go to bed that I want to spend doing something other than preparing and cooking food. Heck, I lit $50 on fire for an Uber yesterday to save an hour when I had a dental appointment two towns over and wanted to get home without taking two buses and a 20-minute walk between the dentist and my apartment. If I'm willing to value my time that highly, swinging by Bucks Teriyaki&Wok (not an ad, just a fan) on East Hill in Kent outside of Seattle for a delicious dinner for under $20 is a no-brainer.\n\nOnce in awhile, usually on a weekend or during a staycation week, I'll cook, and it's usually when I want something very specific that I can't get from a restaurant in the area at any kind of decent quality.

Even long before i realised i was disabled and it started impactin my physical health a lot more as things caught up to me, Oregon was just like \"Yeah, feed this person even if they cant find steady employment ever; why shudnt we do this?\". A lot of the red states wudnt dare allow such things bcuz theyre so convinced that the few ppl takin the meager funds theyve got wud all just pull themselves up by their bootstraps if they didnt have this\n\nBootstraps mentality nearly saw me dead and resulted in me bein homeless for not bein able to do it all myself; feck that", "time": "10 giorni fa", "author": "@SylviaRustyFae", "channel": "UCyF6-C2QYnNZYosGz6MDSEA", "votes": "3", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/bOgG-iiGxYgvd1fIavsgbLdODiod27zy67A4-iyb8py4AWkHDL7kaR7ulLksJ24yfG6eV5PuUg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1741344815.777387}

If you've got a few hundred million, you can buy up a few nice places and rent them out to businesses or people and over the course of 20-50 years you become significantly more wealthy, allowing you to buy more places and obtain more money.

Adam is a smart guy, but he was brought up in this society and our western beliefs are incredibly pervasive. Insidious even. Despite him recognizing that this video itself is cognitively dissonant.  despite showing his distaste for wealth inequality and the unfairness of being poor. He also still \"agrees\" with the idea that humans need incentives to work, that the whipmaster has to be always at your back so that you can aspire to something \"more\".  At it's worse we call it hustle culture.  But it's this false idea that only through hard work and sacrifice can you obtain \"worth\". And truly enjoy life to it's fullest.   It CANT be that all humans deserve joy, pleasure and happiness, because that wouldn't be \"fair\" and it would invalidate all the hard work you did to get where you are.\n\nAnd so this video is him wrestling with that idea, but ultimately not quite getting to the full realization.  He didn't have to buy the $15K. He can buy it, he can afford it (and he can make a video about it that potentially increases his wealth to offset the cost if not entirely pay for it).  But if he truly thought that the $15k fridge was an opulent waste, then he wasn't forced to do it there were other options.

Then for the last two weeks ish of the semester I just polish off whatever's left.\n\nThis week I made beans rice and sausage (just the addition of sausage makes it so much tastier and polish sausage isn't all too expensive in an entire large dish. It's like 5 bucks but all the food comes out to like 10 meals so it's not horrible.) and I also made rice and beef because there was some ultra-thin cut stew meat (I think they just cut it wrong or something?? The coloring was good and it smelled fine and wasn't due to expire for another 4 days when I bought it so I assumed it was just because it was cut into almost paper think strips) so I seared it then made a gravy then watered the gravy down to the appropriate proportions to cook the rice in and threw in the stew meat to stew with the rice.
