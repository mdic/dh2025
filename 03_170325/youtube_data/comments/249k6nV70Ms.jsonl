Neville was shot upstairs but not fatally.  he was marched down to the kitchen because Bamber needed him to be found next to the landline phone, to support the idea that neville made the call for help.   Bamber's last act before leaving the house was to call his own home from the phone.  then a quick cycle home and, on arriving, pick up the ringing phone to make it show that a call connected from the farm to Bamber's home.    it was a very well thought out crime but not without mistake. using the silencer was the problem.   it may have worked out had Bamber not used it, however there's a chance that in shooting the boys first, Neville and June , or Sheila, may have had the chance to call for help before Bamber could kill them, or even subdue him", "time": "9 giorni fa", "author": "@lightlandsky", "channel": "UCGk5Ei_g4z4z5YIWyMXM2pw", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/iui3iR8veaGF5jRQKJy20gT3TE8UiPu-fquRX6PjK8KmHMO1HasPrY-nyAxDpC1tIfAMMukoQA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1741434610.624804}

One could use a toe or an object. \nBut if Shelia had shot herself once in the neck 1st, she'd then have to reposition the gun and chamber another round. I'm thinking going through this rotation and after the subsequent wound to the neck, the position the gun would be in, it should be pretty soaked in blood. I don't know if it was and they covered that? Doesn't sound like they covered much at all. I don't trust Jeremy's girlfriend but whose to say. The whole thing is mystifying. I thought silencers didn't work when they were cold? I know it's only a 22. Or 'two two' as we seem to say here, lol. But still indoors with the sound moderator, I'd think people, the dogs would definitely hear. It's a very strange one. Of course entirely possible he went room to room and that's how it happened.

That‚Äôs not really in her character clearly. Since previously, she goes out to go get help actively. Also, you don‚Äôt typically joke around about killing your parents to get their inheritance. That‚Äôs not the first thing I think about if my parents were killed. I would Morceau be in the thought process that I‚Äôm never gonna see them again or hear them again, I wouldn‚Äôt be like.

Also, how the fuck are they going to try to get him the innocence he didn‚Äôt do this kind of thing when there‚Äôs a literal paint from a shelf that was scraped on the window, the same window that he proceeded to tell his girlfriend that he could go in if he wanted to. I don‚Äôt know, I definitely think that he fucking did it. There‚Äôs way too much evidence against him to say that he did do it. And I think that pinning it on Sheila was bad. I mean obviously it was but still it‚Äôs pretty messed up. But it makes me question why, like, OK I get it so you‚Äôll get your adopted parents, Heritance, when they die, if anything, just fucking wait for that. Are you that unstable with money that you have to kill someone to get it, like there are so many places that could help you manage your money you don‚Äôt have to do that.

Maybe I have short arms but i have a riffle and a silencer, I can‚Äôt even point the gun on myself bc it‚Äôs too long. I can barely point it on myself without the silencer on. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for Sheila to kill everyone without the silencer. If she did, the sound would awaken other members in the house. It would of scared her 2 kids. Someone could of heard the gunshots and call emergency services. But none of that happened. it‚Äôs so rare to find people shooting themselves twice when they are attempting suicide. 1 bullet is usually enough. It would be so stupid for Sheila to kill everyone with the silencer, try to kill herself with the silencer but then realized she can‚Äôt reach the trigger. Go and hide the silencer in the closet then come back to actually shoot herself. Like bffr. Jeremy is the only one that can do it. Plus, if Sheila wanted to kill her mom so much why was the mom not found the same way the father was found? I think Jeremy forced Sheila to stage bc he might of told her ‚Äúdo this or else your kids will die‚Äù", "time": "1 anno fa", "author": "@kaitsenpai", "channel": "UCvttIL-JClYdJKeR4pDqaPA", "votes": "1", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/MfN9tIJgQVnhPponm2NTpgISSfYzLVJAbrBiZg-urrWqvLmX8Gto4yh4l0LdbtsPXNwRvadjHDk=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1710676215.737488}

{"cid": "Ugw6aGAXia8t9cVsyvJ4AaABAg", "text": "Re your deficiencies. If you are b12 deficient then olease ask your doctor to test you MMA and/or homocystein. Bloodlevels on their own don't mean that much. It's the ability to have it taken up by your tissues that counts and the two tests I mentioned can be used to test that. Most often people who can't take up B12 need to inject themselves with it in their muscles (butt or upperleg). Sometimes docs don't allow you do it yourself but enough docs do after a short instruction which in itself is easy. You just need to get over sticking a needle in your muscle, but to me only the skinpricking part is a bit unpleasant. Don't feel the rest \nOral supplements don't work if you have an uptake issue, even if your bloodlevels do go up. \n\nI am just taking a wild guess but perhaps others can be helped here too as it is still commonly believed that if you are not below a certain bloodlevel, there is no problem which I literally am proof of that that isn't true. My levels were low normal. My GPwould have told me it was fine just eat more animal products. But the lab did an extra test, I don't know if that was protocol or just someone who knew more about b12 metabolism and they testerld my MMA which was too high, meaning I had an uptakeproblem. My urologist quickly discovered the resson which can't be undone so I am now on lifelong injections. I likely already have nerveissues and glad they found out and right away put me on injections instead of giving me oral supplements that only masked the problem while destroying my body slowly irreversibly.\n\nSorry for the long post and you likely don't even read this anymore.", "time": "1 anno fa", "author": "@thesplendidinternet36", "channel": "UCdinaFsvy6AqvSbwBB06qZQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/HCHYsxtsMVFgKBtFO8L4O9HDWTsMaSbd5-Ee2ffGRINlD2rZo0C2EzrOu2fjZeGjTmzLfFZrpA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1710676217.997366}

He was convicted, sentenced to death, and executed by electric chair in 1944, thus becoming the youngest American with an exact birth date confirmed to be sentenced to death and executed in the 20th century. It's an absolutely tragic and blatantly infuriating story.. \r\n(I believe the Stephen King novel \"The Green Mile\", which later was adapted into a movie of the same name, was based on- or at least heavily inspired by this case.)\r\nI'd love to see you cover this case someday, if possible, especially since I feel like it doesn't get nearly enough attention. \nIf you took the time to read this, thank you and have a great day/ night!!

Little did my mam know that he was already up our end of the country and he'd went to see some friends from school at a house party. Early hours of May 1st 2009, he got into a little bit of an argument with someone. Now I'm not going to sit here and say my brother was an angel because he wasn't, they got into an argument over weed of all things. The man he was arguing with accused my brother of stealing his stash and he never did, my brother told him to back off and just leave it, to which the other person (his name is Liam Keith Hall) proceeded to attack my brother. Now Liam was a cage fighter at the time (he's since had his fighting license revoked) and he brutally attacked my brother, punched him once in the temple and it automatically killed him, he then proceeded to jump on top of my brother's body and punch his face some more when he was already dead. He fled into the woods and it was his family that handed him into the police. I was 9 when this happened, my younger brother being 7 and he had a daughter at only 4 years old.

He'd always planned on being a cop & thought being an 82nd Airborne Ranger would get him on the force with no problem.  His grandmother was good friends with the police chief though & this man had watched him grow up. Gran invited him to supper the topic came up.  He told us unfortunately given that he had a medical discharge for a skull fracture & frontal lobe TBI  he wasn't going to be able to be a cop here.  \nHe had a hard time finding a job & eventually went to his dad's old friend & got a job as grave digger/limo driver/ cleaner. \nThis being a small town & his boss a very shrewed businessman his funeral home also offered Hazmat clean-up for crime scenes & homes where the deceased had been undiscovered for awhile.  It was a very lucrative business because he was the only one locally. Nearest one was 2 hours away.  So even if he didn't perform the funeral for the deceased, the funeral home that did had to refer business to him if they didn't want to gain the reputation of being cold hearted & making their clients clean up the scene themselves. \n      \n   Our police chief's son committed suicide this way. He'd gone to the graveyard & leaned up against his grandfather's very large & ornately carved headstone. Evidently he sat there awhile too smoking cigarettes & drinking Old Grandad straight from the bottle & chasing it with coke.  When he smoked all his cigarettes he took his boots off, placed the barrel of a double barrel shotgun under his chin & pulled the triggers with his big toe. \nThis gun had been his grandfather's. \n \n He left no note but it was definitely a suicide. My husband was called in to assist in working the grid pattern to ensure there was nothing left for what Chief called \" Souvenirs for the Looky Loo's & f*cking delinquent bastards\"\n    It's a good thing he did call the guys in though because they had to build the grid 18 rows back & 15 rows on either side.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@Mosaic_Crone", "channel": "UC4EbKgLsna0h-YWHk4I__yQ", "votes": "0", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/_04QQDqXkQRVe5dFrjunyQWySsOZBmXkCPMzpv6xOA0wPoOyjrC4eQNHIjYPBOQlCMYpvEIiOg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": false, "time_parsed": 1679053836.53325}

BUT then again, because rifles are heavy it would be very easy to lie down put the rifle along your body and pull the trigger with your thumb. AND the body jerks when hit, the second shot could have been another pull by her thumb as a jerking reaction. triggers are very sensitive. WHY didn't the police do gunshot residue on her hand??? He might have been driving slow because he didn't want to get there before police, if I thought of what had just potentially happened I def would not want to get there first and who knows if he sped up once the police car passed him.

The few things that get me though is if the mother was the main motive, why wasn't she the one shot the most? We have seen time and time again that when it's usually a crime of passion, it's overkill. You would think the mother would have been the one beat up and shot the most. \n\nAlso, I obviously can't speak for the father but you would think he would just call emergency services if his daughter was being threatening with a gun. She's been in and out of the hospital before so it doesn't seem like they were ones to really just ignore or pretend she wasn't ill. Why call your son? \n\nThe last thing is the father being the one separated. It seems like he was made to get out of the way because he was main threat. It would make sense that if it was one of the children they would both want him out of the way but it just seems like if it was Sheila she would still have taken out that anger on her mother. \n\nI'm not sure.

They were so young and she was so misunderstood bc mental health was poorly researched back then and for the defense of his brother to use her as an escape goat and dragging her life and suffering to everyone to know. A very sad case all around.

Also, what kind of killer can go through lengths to shoot themselves twice in the neck, that's just not possible, especially if it's a shotgun, this clearly shows that Sheila was innocent the entire time even though she had some mental problems, not what Jeremy described about her though. Sheila even looks innocent, look-wise, she's small, petite, and fragile. She can be easily overpowered and handled whereas Jeremy who's much taller, stronger and has guts to kill someone in cold blood because of his violent and toxic and narcissistic nature can obviously be the one who's guilty for all 5 deaths, nonetheless.

They told me about June's religious extremes and the damage it was having on Sheila. Our mutual friend hoped I could help Sheila with spiritual aspects and more. I only ever saw Sheila under the influence of drugs...be that medication or illegal substances I don't know. She was as spaced out while functioning that it was possible to be. She just wasn't \"there\" and it was so sad. She had showed me her modelling portfolio. She looked lovely in this pics of course, though they were dated at that stage. \nI was in Ireland when the news of the murders happened. My Dad was filling up the car with petrol and there was the rack of papers out the front. There was Sheila on the front pages. They had chosen a glamorous pic of her but with the horrific headline that she had killed her family, and I was...well...what...what the hell...what??? I had the phone number to her flat and trying to ring to hope to find someone to speak with but, of course it wasn't answered at that time.\nIt DID seem plausible she had done it, but that doesn't mean she did do it.  At the beginning I really did think she'd done it. I mean, she really was a mess and, from what I know, was not getting the support she needed. \nThe facts are what matters, but with the latest interest in the tragedy I find myself going back and reviewing it all.", "time": "2 anni fa", "author": "@jwsuicides8095", "channel": "UC60-_nhyXerpfmv6TdbhFXQ", "votes": "27", "replies": "", "photo": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mFMRWEHVww2xeRBJSpeGSLjHn3ULgdd9MV-AWuHebCD7Q=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "heart": false, "reply": true, "time_parsed": 1679053858.242373}

June was religious to the point of of obsession. Jeremy didn‚Äôt really want to take over the family business and run the farm, he was more interested in cars, women and drinking. Sheila hated guns. The police didn‚Äôt enter the property for hours and hours as they thought they saw a curtain twitch in the farm house window, they assumed the shooter was still alive.
