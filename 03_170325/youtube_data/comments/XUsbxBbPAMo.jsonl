It’s quite famous now and gets tourists, but locals do go there too. Bonci is very famous, but it will be almost certainly locals if you go to the panificio and not the pizzarium, which is almost exclusively tourists now (especially this time of the year). All of the reasonable spend restaurants are going to be mostly locals apart from Armando’s. In the moderate range, Roscioli is very touristy now, but the products are genuinely excellent. If you are going to be there within the next month and don’t have a reservation, you almost certainly will not get in, but you can go to the caffe a few doors away. They don’t have the same menu though. The bars will be a mix. Of course the hotel bar will be mostly tourists, but locals will go there for a nicer place. Of them all, Angelini is the most local apart from the tourists who are staying in the neighbourhood. Almost all of the gelato places will be mostly tourists because I put ones that are near the sites that are good since there are lots that are not good. Locals do go to La Romana, but it would dependent on which location you choose. Iomotti is very local and a bit away from the tourist sites, but it’s my favourite so I included it. Locals will go to Giolitti because it is quite famous, but there will be lots of tourists there too since it’s pretty central to everything. Regarding safety, Rome is quite safe, but the area around Termini station can be a bit seedy so I would recommend to avoid that area at night.
